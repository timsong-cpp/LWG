<p>
Currently, some operations of <tt>std::flat_map</tt> are specified to construct a <tt>key_equiv</tt> 
object for calling <tt>ranges::unique</tt> to remove duplicated elements. It seems that the comparator 
is required to be copied twice before calling <tt>ranges::unique</tt>.
<p/>
If we make <tt>key_equiv</tt> to an aggregate class, then the comparator will be only copied once. 
Furtherly, if we use a <tt>std::reference_wrapper&lt;const key_compare&gt;</tt> as the member of 
<tt>key_equiv</tt>, then we will be able to avoid copying. Such differences seem to be observable.
<p/>
Should we require to avoid copying, or explicitly say that implementations can either make copies or avoid copying?
<p/>
Likewise, <tt>std::flat_map::value_comp</tt> and <tt>std::flat_multimap::value_comp</tt> seem to be 
required to copy the comparator twice due to the exposition-only constructor of <tt>value_compare</tt>. 
<p/>
Should we make the constructor take a <tt>const</tt> reference?
