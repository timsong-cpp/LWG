<title>Version macro for <tt>allocate_at_least</tt></title>

<p>
In Issaquah, we just adopted <paper num="P2652R0"/>, forbidding user specialization of <tt>allocator_traits</tt>. 
<p/>
It looks like we did not deem that worthy of a feature macro.
<p/>
However, it also changed the interface of the C++23 addition, <tt>allocate_at_least</tt>, which is covered by the macro 
<tt>__cpp_lib_allocate_at_least</tt>.
<p/>
I believe we should have updated that macro for this significant change in how that function is accessed 
(from free function to a member of <tt>allocator_traits</tt>). Unfortunately, there are no more meetings 
to process a comment to that effect, and I suspect this rises beyond the purview of an editorial change, 
although I live in hope (as the original paper left the value of the macro to the editor, although we 
approved existing working papers where that macro does have a value, i.e., status quo).

<note>2023-03-22; Reflector poll</note>
<p>
Set status to Tentatively Ready after seven votes in favour during reflector poll.
But "if we don’t get the editors to do it for C++23 there doesn’t seem to be
any point doing it."

This wording is relative to <paper num="N4928"/>.

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[version.syn]"/>, header <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> synopsis, as indicated and replace
the placeholder <tt>YYYYMM</tt> by the year and month of adoption of <paper num="P2652R0"/>:</p>
