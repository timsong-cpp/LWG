<p>
UTC epoch is not correctly defined UTC has an officially recorded epoch of 1/1/1972 00:00:00 
and is 10 seconds behind TAI.
This can be confirmed through reference to the 
<a href="https://www.bipm.org/cc/CCTF/Allowed/18/CCTF_09-32_noteUTC.pdf#page=6">BIPM</a> (the 
body that oversees international metrology)
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"The defining epoch of 1 January 1972, <tt>0 h 0m 0 s</tt> UTC was set 10 s behind TAI, which
was the approximate accumulated difference between TAI and UT1 since the inception of
TAI in 1958, and a unique fraction of a second adjustment was applied so that UTC would
differ from TAI by an integral number of seconds. The recommended maximum departure of 
UTC from UT1 was 0.7 s. The term "leap second" was introduced for the stepped second."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Proposed change:
<p/>
<tt>utc_clock</tt> and <tt>utc_timepoint</tt> should correctly report relative to the official 
UTC epoch. 27.2.2.1 footnote 1 should read: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In contrast to <tt>sys_time</tt>, which does not take leap seconds into account, 
<tt>utc_clock</tt> and its associated <tt>time_point</tt>, <tt>utc_time</tt>, count time,
including leap seconds, since 1972-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. [<i>Example:</i> 
<tt>clock_cast&lt;utc_clock&gt;(sys_seconds{sys_days{1972y/January/1}}).time_since_epoch()</tt> 
is <tt>0s</tt>. <tt>clock_cast&lt;utc_clock&gt;(sys_seconds{sys_days{2000y/January/1}}).time_since_epoch()</tt>
is <tt>883'612'822</tt>, which is <tt>10'197 * 86'400s + 22s</tt>. &mdash; <i>end example</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<b>Howard Hinnant:</b>
<p/>
Clarify that the epoch of <code>utc_clock</code> is intended to be <tt>1970-01-01</tt>.
<p/>
Rationale: The main use case of <code>utc_clock</code> is to get the correct number of seconds 
when subtracting time points straddling a leap second insertion point, and this computation 
is independent of the epoch. Furthermore learning/teaching that <code>utc_clock</code> is 
<code>system_clock</code> except that <code>utc_clock</code> includes leap seconds is easier.  
And this fact is more easily understood when comparing the underlying <code>.time_since_epoch()</code> 
of equivalent time points from each clock.
