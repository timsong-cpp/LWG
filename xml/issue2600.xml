<p>
DR <iref ref="41"/>, "Ios_base needs <tt>clear()</tt>, <tt>exceptions()</tt>" stopped short of providing the interface 
suggested in its title, but it did require the underlying state to be stored in <tt>ios_base</tt>. Because <tt>rdstate()</tt> 
is also missing, <tt>ios_base</tt> manipulators relying on <tt>iword</tt> and <tt>pword</tt> cannot detect failure. 
The only safe alternative is to manipulate a derived class, which must be a template.
<p/>
libc++ already provides the interface as a nonconforming extension. libstdc++ implements the internal state but leaves 
it frustratingly inaccessible, as specified. Any conforming implementation should be able to provide the interface 
without ABI problems.

This is really a request for an (feature) API. Passing to LEWG.

<p>Recommend NAD: iostreams aren't used in this way enough to spend committee time on it. However, a paper could change our minds.</p>
