<p>
The class template <tt>complex</tt> synopsis in <sref ref="[complex]"/> shows the following member function template:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class X&gt; constexpr complex&amp; operator= (const complex&lt;X&gt;&amp;);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
but does not specify its semantics. This affects a code example such as the following one:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;complex&gt;

int main()
{
  std::complex&lt;double&gt; zd(1, 1);
  std::complex&lt;float&gt; zf(2, 0);
  zd = zf;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This problem exists since the 1998 version of the standard (at that time this was declared in subclause [lib.complex]),
and even though this looks like a "copy-assignment-like" operation, its effects aren't implied by our general
<sref ref="[functions.within.classes]"/> wording (a function template is never considered as copy assignment operator,
see <sref ref="[class.copy.assign]"/>).
<p/>
It should be point out that the refactoring done by <paper num="P1467R9"/> had caused some other members to become finally
specified that were not specified before, but in addition to LWG <iref ref="3934"/>'s observation about the missing
specification of the assignment operator taking a value type as parameter, this is now an additional currently unspecified 
member, but unaffected by any decision on LWG <iref ref="3933"/>.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4950"/>.
</p>
<ol>

<li>
<p>Add a new prototype specification between the current paragraphs 8 and 9 of <sref ref="[complex.member.ops]"/> as indicated:</p>

<p>
[<i>Drafting note</i>: Similar to the proposed wording for LWG <iref ref="3934"/>, the wording form used below intentionally 
deviates from the rest of the [complex.member.ops] wording forms, because it seems much simpler and clearer to follow the wording 
forms used that specify the effects of <tt>imag</tt> and <tt>real</tt> functions plus borrowing relevant parts from 
<sref ref="[complex.members]"/> p2.]
