<p>
Various WG21 members have commented that the use of "safe" in the names <tt>safe_range</tt>, 
<tt>enable_safe_range</tt>, <tt>safe_iterator_t</tt>, and <tt>safe_subrange_t</tt> to mean "fairly 
unlikely to produce dangling iterators" is inappropriate. The term "safe" has very strong 
connotations in some application domains, and these names don't intend such connotations. We 
could avoid confusion by changing these names to avoid the use of "safe". The Ranges Illuminati 
has deemed "borrowed" to be more appropriate: it reflects the fact that such ranges often 
"borrow" iterators from an adapted range which allows them to not be lifetime-bound to the 
adapting range.
