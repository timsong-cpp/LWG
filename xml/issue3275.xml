<title>Why does <tt>time_get::do_get</tt> require a valid pointer when none of the others do?</title>

According to <sref ref="[locale.time.get.virtuals]"/> p11:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> <tt>t</tt> shall point to an object
</p></blockquote>
<p>
[Note: In my "Mandates" paper, I changed this to "<i>Expects:</i> <tt>t</tt> points to an object"]
<p/>
Nevertheless, it's odd, and inconsistent. <tt>time_get::get</tt> does not have any such stated requirement, 
and it calls <tt>do_get</tt>. None of the other "time" calls in <tt>time_get</tt> have such a (stated) 
requirement.
<p/>
I believe that this requirement is redundant, that it is implied by the wording in P12 and P14.
<p/>
P12: "or until it has extracted and assigned those <tt>struct tm</tt> members"
<p/>
P14: "It is unspecified whether multiple calls to <tt>do_get()</tt> with the address of the same 
<tt>struct tm</tt> object will update the current contents of the object or simply overwrite its members."
<p/>
If the pointer is invalid (null, or points to unmapped memory, say), you've got UB anyway.
<p/>
All the other calls in [locale.time.get.virtuals] were from C++98. <tt>do_get_time</tt> was added in C++11, 
and p11 originally said "<tt>t</tt> shall be dereferenceable". 
<p/>
This was changed to "<tt>t</tt> shall point to an object" as part of the resolution of CWG issue 
<a href="https://wg21.link/cwg342">342</a>
