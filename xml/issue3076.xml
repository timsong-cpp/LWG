The following code fails to compile for surprising reasons.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;string_view&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
   string s0;
   basic_string s1(s0, 1, 1);
   // WANT: basic_string(const basic_string&amp;, size_type, size_type, const Allocator&amp; = Allocator())
   // CONFLICT: basic_string(size_type, charT, const Allocator&amp;)

   basic_string s2("cat"sv, 1, 1);
   // WANT: basic_string(const T&amp;, size_type, size_type, const Allocator&amp; = Allocator())
   // CONFLICT: basic_string(size_type, charT, const Allocator&amp;)

   basic_string s3("cat", 1);
   // WANT: basic_string(const charT *, size_type, const Allocator&amp; = Allocator())
   // CONFLICT: basic_string(const charT *, const Allocator&amp;)
}

<p>
For <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt>, the signature <tt>basic_string(size_type, charT, const Allocator&amp;)</tt> participates in CTAD. <tt>size_type</tt> is non-deduced (it will be substituted later, so the compiler 
can't immediately realize that <tt>s0</tt> or <tt>"cat"sv</tt> are totally non-viable arguments). 
<tt>charT</tt> is deduced to be <tt>int</tt> (weird, but not the problem). Finally, <tt>Allocator</tt> 
is deduced to be <tt>int</tt>. Then the compiler tries to substitute for <tt>size_type</tt>, but 
this ends up giving int to <tt>allocator_traits</tt> in a non-SFINAE context, so compilation fails.
<p/>
<tt>s3</tt> fails for a slightly different reason. <tt>basic_string(const charT *, const Allocator&amp;)</tt> participates in CTAD, deducing <tt>charT</tt> to be <tt>char</tt> (good) and <tt>Allocator</tt> to be 
<tt>int</tt>. This is an exact match, which is better than the constructor that the user actually wants 
(where <tt>int</tt> would need to be converted to <tt>size_type</tt>, which is unsigned). So CTAD deduces <tt>basic_string&lt;char, char_traits&lt;char&gt;, int&gt;</tt>, which is the wrong type.
<p/>
This problem appears to be unique to <tt>basic_string</tt> and its heavily overloaded set of constructors. 
I haven't figured out how to fix it by adding (non-greedy) deduction guides. The conflicting constructors 
are always considered during CTAD, regardless of whether deduction guides are provided that correspond 
to the desired or conflicting constructors. (That's because deduction guides are preferred as a late 
tiebreaker in overload resolution; if a constructor provides a better match it will be chosen before 
tiebreaking.) It appears that we need to constrain the conflicting constructors themselves; this will 
have no effect on actual usage (where <tt>Allocator</tt> will be an allocator) but will prevent CTAD 
from considering them for non-allocators. As this is unusual, I believe it deserves a <i>Note</i>. 
This has been implemented in MSVC.
