<p>
<tt>std::swap</tt> overloads are separately declared in many standard library headers. It is likely expected 
that when a program includes correct headers for standard library types to be swapped, a <tt>std::swap</tt> call, 
with template argument deduced from arguments, selects the correct overload.
<p/>
However, if one explicitly specifies template arguments for a <tt>std::swap</tt> call, there would be possibly 
undesired overloads for which templates arguments are fully obtained, and thus undesired instantiation and 
ill-formed may be triggered.
<p/>
Perhaps we should explicitly state that explicitly specifying templates for <tt>std::swap</tt> is unsupported 
(having unspecified effects and possibly ill-formed), like taking address of non-address functions 
(<sref ref="[namespace.std]"/>/6) and explicitly specifying template arguments for most standard algorithms 
(<sref ref="[algorithms.requirements]"/>/15), to avoid possible reading that there are some guarantees, derived 
from signatures of overloads, for doing so.

Not unique to <code>std::swap</code>. We should forbid this throughout
the standard library.
