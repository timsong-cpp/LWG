<title>Member function reentrancy should be implementation-defined</title>

N3936 <sref ref="[reentrancy]"/>/1 talks about "functions", but that doesn't address the scenario of calling different member 
functions of a single object. Member functions often have to violate and then re-establish invariants. For example, vectors 
often have "holes" during insertion, and element constructors/destructors/etc. shouldn't be allowed to observe the vector 
while it's in this invariant-violating state. The [reentrancy] Standardese should be extended to cover member functions, 
so that implementers can either say that member function reentrancy is universally prohibited, or selectively allowed for 
very specific scenarios.
<p/>
(For clarity, this issue has been split off from LWG <iref ref="2382"/>.)

AJM confirmed with SG1 that they had no special concerns with this issue, and LWG should retain ownership.
<p/>
AM: this is too overly broad as it also covers calling the exact same member function on a different object<br/>
STL: so you insert into a map, and copying the value triggers another insertion into a different map of the same type<br/>
GR: reentrancy seems to imply the single-threaded case, but needs to consider the multi-threaded case
<p/>
Needs more wording.

<p>Marshall to ping STL for updated wording.<br/></p>

<p>I don't have any better suggestions than my original PR at the moment.</p>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3936.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[reentrancy]"/> p1 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- Except where explicitly specified in this standard, it is implementation-defined which functions <ins>(including different 
member functions called on a single object)</ins> in the Standard C++ library may be recursively reentered.
</p>
</blockquote>
