<title>Effects of negative <tt>streamsize</tt> in iostreams</title>

<p>
A third party test suite tries to exercise <tt>istream::ignore(N)</tt> with a negative value of 
<tt>N</tt> and expects that the implementation will treat <tt>N</tt> as if it were <tt>0</tt>. Our 
implementation asserts that (<tt>N &gt;= 0</tt>) holds and aborts the test.
</p>

<p>
I can't find anything in section 27 that prohibits such values but I don't
see what the effects of such calls should be, either (this applies to
a number of unformatted input functions as well as some member functions
of the <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> template).

<p>
I propose that we add to each function in clause 27 that takes an argument, say <tt>N</tt>, of type 
<tt>streamsize</tt> a <i>Requires</i> clause saying that "<tt>N &gt;= 0</tt>." The intent is to allow 
negative streamsize values in calls to <tt>precision()</tt> and <tt>width()</tt> but disallow it in 
calls to <tt>streambuf::sgetn()</tt>, <tt>istream::ignore()</tt>, or <tt>ostream::write()</tt>.
</p>

<note>Kona: The LWG agreed that this is probably what we want. However, we
  need a review to find all places where functions in clause 27 take
  arguments of type <tt>streamsize</tt> that shouldn't be allowed to go
  negative. Martin will do that review.</note>
