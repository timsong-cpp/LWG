As a result of <a href="https://wg21.link/cwg2094" title="2094. Trivial copy/move constructor for class with volatile member. Status: C++17">Core DR 2094</a>
(concerning triviality of volatile-qualified subobjects),
<code>is_trivially_copyable_v&lt;volatile int&gt;</code> is now true,
which means that `volatile int` is a valid type for `std::atomic`.
</p>
<p>
Libstdc++ and libc++ can't actually compile that type though,
and that seems very sensible to me.
</p>

<p>
Even worse is that <code>std::atomic&lt;volatile int&gt;</code> will not
select the specialization for `int`, because that is clearly specified by
<sref ref="[atomics.types.int]"/> to only be for cv-unqualified types.
<sref ref="[atomics.types.float]"/> also says it's only for cv-unqualified
floating-point types. And <sref ref="[atomics.types.pointer]"/> will only
match cv-unqualified pointer types.
This means that even when <code>std::atomic&lt;volatile int&gt;</code>
compiles (as with MSVC) you can't use members like `fetch_add` because that
only exists on the specialization, not the primary template.
</p>

<p>
Should we add something to `std::atomic` to make it not valid again,
as was the case (and presumably the original intent) before CWG DR 2094?
</p>

<p>
A similar question exists for <code>std::atomic_ref&lt;volatile int&gt;</code>
although there are apparently valid uses for that type. However, the
`atomic_ref` specializations for integers, floats, and pointers are only
for cv-unqualified types, so it doesn't work usefully.
For `atomic_ref` we might want to allow `volatile`-qualified types <em>and</em>
make the specializations match them.
