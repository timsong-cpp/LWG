<title>Missing guarantees for `forward_list` modifiers</title>

<p>
The new `std::list` members added by <paper num="p1206r7"/>,
<code>insert_range(const_iterator, R&amp;&amp;)</code>,
<code>prepend_range(R&amp;&amp;)</code>, and
<code>append_range(R&amp;&amp;)</code>,
have the same exception safety guarantee as
`std::list::insert(const_iterator, InputIterator, InputIterator)`, which is:
<blockquote>
<i>Remarks</i>:
Does not affect the validity of iterators and references.
If an exception is thrown, there are no effects.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
This guarantee was achieved for the new `list` functions simply by placing
them in the same set of declarations as the existing `insert` overloads,
at the start of <sref ref="[list.modifiers]"/>.
</p>

<p>
However, the new `std::forward_list` members,
<code>insert_range_after(const_iterator, R&amp;&amp;)</code> and
<code>prepend_range(R&amp;&amp;)</code>,
do not have the same guarantee as `forward_list::insert_after`.
This looks like an omission caused by the fact that `insert_after`'s
exception safety guarantee is given in a separate paragraph at the start
of <sref ref="[forward.list.modifiers]"/>:
<blockquote>
None of the overloads of `insert_after`
shall affect the validity of iterators and references,
and `erase_after` shall invalidate only iterators and references
to the erased elements.
If an exception is thrown during `insert_after` there shall be no effect.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I think we should give similar guarantees for `insert_range_after`
and `prepend_range`.
The change might also be appropriate for `emplace_after` as well.
A "no effects" guarantee is already given for `push_front` and `emplace_front`
in <sref ref="[container.reqmts]"/> p66, although that doesn't say anything
about iterator invalidation so we might want to add that to
<sref ref="[forward.list.modifiers]"/> too.
For the functions that insert a single element, it's trivial to not modify
the list if allocating a new node of constructing the element throws.
The strong exception safety guarantee for the multi-element insertion functions
is easily achieved by inserting into a temporary `forward_list` first,
then using `splice_after` which is non-throwing.

<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
</p>
<p>It was suggested to change
"If an exception is thrown by any of these member functions
that insert elements there is no effect on the forward_list"
to simply
"If an exception is thrown by any of these member functions
there is no effect on the forward_list"
</p>

<note>2024-10-09; LWG suggested improved wording</note>
<p>
The proposed resolution potentially mandates a change to `resize` when
increasing the size, requiring implementations to "roll back" earlier
insertions if a later one throws, so that the size is left unchanged.
It appears that libstdc++ and MSVC already do this, libc++ does not.
