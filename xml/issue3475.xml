<p>
<tt>thread</tt>'s constructor needs to <tt><i>decay-copy</i></tt> the supplied parameters and callable over to the started 
thread through an operating system API that generally only accepts a single <tt>void*</tt>. The MSVC++ and libc++ 
implementations do this by putting the parameters in a <tt>std::tuple</tt> allocated from the heap, passing a 
pointer to that tuple through the operating system API, and leaving ownership of the parameters to the other thread.
<p/>
It might be theoretically possible to introduce an additional copy and synchronization where the starting thread 
blocks for the started thread to make a move constructed copy of that tuple from the parameters, but that would 
introduce unreasonable synchronization overhead since the starting thread would have to block for all TLS 
initializers and similar in the started thread.
<p/>
It is technically possible to implement the current design by transforming this allocation failure into 
<tt>resource_unavailable_try_again</tt>, but the description for this error in the standard is that some thread-based 
limitation has been reached, not a general memory limit, so that doesn't seem to meet the spirit of the requirement.
