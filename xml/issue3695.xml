<title>The standard-layout property of char-like types serves for nothing</title>

<p>
Currently char-like types are defined as non-array trivial and standard-layout types (<sref ref="[strings.general]"/>). 
However, as far as I know, there is no actual operation specified in the standard or used in implementations 
requiring a char-like type to be standard-layout (unlike the triviality, which is related to <tt>charT()</tt>, etc.). 
Implementations are merely <tt>static_assert</tt>-ing the standard-layout property of element types.
<p/>
As the standard library almost never requires a user-provided type to be standard-layout now (other suspicious 
exceptions are program-defined specializations of <tt>std::atomic&lt;T*&gt;</tt>), I think char-like types should 
just be non-array trivial types.
