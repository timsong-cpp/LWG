<title><tt>resize_file</tt> has impossible postcondition</title>

<tt>resize_file</tt> has this postcondition (after resolving late comment 42, see <a href="http://wg21.link/p0489r0">P0489R0</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Postcondition:</i> <tt>file_size(p) == new_size</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is impossible for an implementation to satisfy, due to the possibility of file system races. 
This is not actually a postcondition; rather, it is an effect that need no longer hold when the function returns.

<p>This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4713">N4713</a>.</p>

[<i>Drafting note:</i> I considered a slightly more verbose form: "Causes the
size in bytes of the file <tt>p</tt> resolves to, as determined by <tt>file_size</tt>
(<sref ref="[fs.op.file_size]"/>), to be equal to <tt>new_size</tt>, as if by POSIX
<tt>truncate</tt>." but I don't think it's an improvement. The intent of the
proposed wording is that if either <tt>file_size(p)</tt> or <tt>truncate(p.c_str())</tt>
would fail then an error occurs, but no call to <tt>file_size</tt> is required,
and file system races might change the size before any such call does occur.]

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[fs.op.resize_file]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
void resize_file(const path&amp; p, uintmax_t new_size);
void resize_file(const path&amp; p, uintmax_t new_size, error_code&amp; ec) noexcept;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <del><i>Postconditions:</i> <tt>file_size(p) == new_size</tt></del><ins><i>Effects:</i> Causes 
the size that would be returned by <tt>file_size(p)</tt> to be equal to <tt>new_size</tt>, as if 
by POSIX <tt>truncate</tt></ins>.
<p/>
-2- <i>Throws:</i> As specified in <sref ref="[fs.err.report]"/>.
<p/>
<del>-3- <i>Remarks:</i> Achieves its postconditions as if by POSIX <tt>truncate()</tt>.</del>
