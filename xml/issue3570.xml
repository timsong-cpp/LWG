<p>
<tt>basic_osyncstream::emit</tt> seems rather similar to <tt>basic_ostream::flush</tt> &mdash;
both are "flushing" operations that forward to member functions of the
<tt>streambuf</tt> and set <tt>badbit</tt> if those functions fail. But the former isn't
currently specified as an unformatted output function, so it a) doesn't construct or check a 
<tt>sentry</tt> and b) doesn't set <tt>badbit</tt> if <tt>emit</tt> exits via an exception. At 
least the latter appears to be clearly desirable &mdash; a <tt>streambuf</tt> operation that throws 
ordinarily results in <tt>badbit</tt> being set.
<p/>
The reference implementation in <paper num="P0053R7"/> constructs a <tt>sentry</tt> and only
calls <tt>emit</tt> on the <tt>streambuf</tt> if the <tt>sentry</tt> converts to <tt>true</tt>, 
so this seems to be an accidental omission in the wording.

This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4885">N4885</a>.

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[syncstream.osyncstream.members]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
void emit();
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <i>Effects:</i> <ins>Behaves as an unformatted output function (<sref ref="[ostream.unformatted]"/>). 
After constructing a <tt>sentry</tt> object, c</ins><del>C</del>alls <tt>sb.emit()</tt>. If that call 
returns <tt>false</tt>, calls <tt>setstate(ios_base::badbit)</tt>.
