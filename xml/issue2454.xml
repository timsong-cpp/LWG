<p>
Eric Niebler pointed out that <tt>raw_storage_iterator</tt> should give access
to the <tt>OutputIterator</tt> it wraps.
<p/>
This helps alleviate the exception-safety issue pointed out in the
discussion of LWG <iref ref="2127"/>, as an exception can be caught and then
destructors can be run for the constructed elements in the range
<tt>[begin, raw.base())</tt>
</p>

NJ: Is this "const" correct [in "base()"]? DK: Yes, we always do that. NJ: And the output iterator is not qualifying in any way? 
AM/DK: That wouldn't make sense. NJ: OK.
<p/>
VV: What did LEWG say about this feature request? In other words, why is this a library issue? AM: LEWG/JY thought this wouldn't 
be a contentious issue.
<p/>
NJ: I really hope the split of LEWG and LWG will be fixed soon, since it's only wasting time. VV: So you want to spend even 
more of your time on discussions that LEWG has?
<p/>
AM: I think this specified correctly. I'm not wild about it. But no longer bothered to stand in its way.
<p/>
GR: Why do we need to repeat the type in "Returns" even though it's part of the synopsis? AM: Good point, but not worth fixing.
<p/>
NJ: Why is "<tt>base()</tt>" for <tt>reverse_iterator</tt> commented with "// explicit"? AM: I guess in 1998 that was the 
only way to say this.
<p/>
AM: So, it's tentatively ready.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/prot/14882fdis/n4140.pdf">N4140</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add a new function to the synopsis in <sref ref="[storage.iterator]"/> p1:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
namespace std {
  template &lt;class OutputIterator, class T&gt;
  class raw_storage_iterator
    : public iterator&lt;output_iterator_tag,void,void,void,void&gt; {
  public:
    explicit raw_storage_iterator(OutputIterator x);

    raw_storage_iterator&lt;OutputIterator,T&gt;&amp; operator*();
    raw_storage_iterator&lt;OutputIterator,T&gt;&amp; operator=(const T&amp; element);
    raw_storage_iterator&lt;OutputIterator,T&gt;&amp; operator++();
    raw_storage_iterator&lt;OutputIterator,T&gt; operator++(int);
    <ins>OutputIterator base() const;</ins>
};
}
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Insert the new function and a new paragraph series after p7:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<ins>OutputIterator base() const;</ins>
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-?- <i>Returns</i>: An iterator of type <tt>OutputIterator</tt> that points to the
same value as <tt>*this</tt> points to.</ins>
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
</li>

</ol>
