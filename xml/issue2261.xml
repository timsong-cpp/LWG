<title>Are containers required to use their '<tt>pointer</tt>' type internally?</title>

<p>
Is a container <tt>C</tt> only supposed to refer to allocated memory (blocks of
contiguous storage, nodes, etc.) through objects of type <tt>C::pointer</tt>
rather than <tt>C::value_type*</tt>?
</p>

<p>
I don't see anything explicitly requiring this, so a container could
immediately convert the result of <tt>get_allocator().allocate(1)</tt> to a
built-in pointer of type <tt>value_type*</tt> and only deal with the built-in
pointer until it needs to deallocate it again, but that removes most
of the benefit of allowing allocators to use custom pointer types.
</p>

<p>
This issue is basically the same issue as LWG <iref ref="1521"/>, which agrees it's an issue, 
to be dealt with in the future, so I request that <iref ref="2261"/> not be closed as a dup 
unless we reopen <iref ref="1521"/>.
</p>

<note>2016-08, Zhihao comments</note>
<p>The <tt>pointer</tt> types are not exposed in the container interface,
and we consider that the memory allocation constraints
"all containers defined in this clause obtain memory using an
allocator" already implies the reasonable expectation.  We
propose the fix as non-normative.

<p>Tues PM: General agreement on direction, Alisdair and Billy to update wording</p>
<p>Fri AM: Moved to Tentatively Ready</p>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N4606.</p>

<note>Drafting notes: if people prefer this to be normative, strip
the "Note" markups.</note>

<p>Modify <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/8 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Unless otherwise specified, all containers defined in this clause obtain
memory using an allocator (see <sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/>).
<ins>[<i>Note:</i> In particular, containers and iterators
do not store references to allocated elements other than through the
allocator's pointer type, i.e., as objects of type <tt><i>P</i></tt> or
<tt>pointer_traits&lt;<i>P</i>&gt;::template rebind&lt;<i>unspecified</i>&gt;</tt>,
where <tt><i>P</i></tt> is
<tt>allocator_traits&lt;allocator_type&gt;::pointer</tt>. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</ins>
</p></blockquote>
</resolution>
