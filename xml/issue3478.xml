From <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/63497978/2069064">StackOverflow</a>, the program:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;ranges&gt;

int main() 
{
  std::string s = " text ";
  auto sv = std::ranges::views::split(s, ' ');                    
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::ranges::distance(sv.begin(), sv.end());
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
prints 2 (as specified), but it really should print 3. If a range has <tt>N</tt> delimiters in it, 
splitting should produce <tt>N+1</tt> pieces. If the <tt>N</tt><sup>th</sup> delimiter is the last 
element in the input range, <tt>views::split</tt> produces only <tt>N</tt> pieces &mdash; it doesn't 
emit a trailing empty range.
<p/>
Going through a bunch of languages gets a sense of what they all do here. There are basically two 
groups (and Haskell goes in both because it has several different split functions)
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Rust, Python, Javascript, Go, Kotlin, Haskell's <tt>"splitOn"</tt> all provide <tt>N+1</tt> parts 
if there were <tt>N</tt> delimiters.</p></li>
<li><p>APL, D, Elixir, Haskell's <tt>"words"</tt>, Ruby, and Clojure all compress all empty words. 
Splitting <tt>" x "</tt> on <tt>" "</tt> would give <tt>["x"]</tt> here, whereas the languages in the 
above group would give <tt>["", "x", ""]</tt></p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Java is distinct from both groups in that it is mostly a first category language, except that by default 
it removes all trailing empty strings (but it keeps all leading and intermediate empty strings, unlike 
the second category languages) &mdash; although it has a parameter that lets you keep the trailing ones too.
<p/>
C++20's behavior is closest to Java's default, except that it only removes one trailing empty string 
instead of every trailing empty string &mdash; and this behavior is not parameterizeable. But I think the 
intent is to be squarely in the first category, so I think the current behavior is just a specification error.
<p/>
Many of these languages also provide an additional extra parameter to limit how many splits happen (e.g. 
Java, Kotlin, Python, Rust, JavaScript), but that's a separate design question.
