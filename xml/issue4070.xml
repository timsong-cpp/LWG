<sref ref="[fs.path.fmtr.funcs]"/> says:

<blockquote>
If `charT` is `char`, `path::value_type` is `wchar_t`,
and the literal encoding is UTF-8, then the escaped path is
transcoded from the native encoding for wide character strings to UTF-8
with maximal subparts of ill-formed subsequences substituted with
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">u+fffd</span>
replacement character per the Unicode Standard [...].
Otherwise, transcoding is implementation-defined.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
This seems to mean that the Unicode substitutions are only done
for an escaped path, i.e. when the `?` option is used. Otherwise, the form
of transcoding is completely implementation-defined.
However, this makes no sense.
An escaped string will have no ill-formed subsequences, because they will
already have been replaced as per <sref ref="[format.string.escaped]"/>:
<blockquote>
Otherwise (<em>X</em> is a sequence of ill-formed code units),
each code unit <em>U</em> is appended to <em>E</em> in order as
the sequence <code>\x{<em>hex-digit-sequence</em>}</code>,
where <code><em>hex-digit-sequence</em></code> is the shortest hexadecimal
representation of <em>U</em> using lower-case hexadecimal digits.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
So only unescaped strings can have ill-formed sequences by the time
we do transcoding to `char`, but whether or not any
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">u+fffd</span> substitution
occurs is just implementation-defined.
</p>

<p>
I believe we want to specify the substitutions are done when transcoding
an <em>unescaped</em> path (and it doesn't matter whether we specify it
for escaped paths, because it's a no-op if escaping happens first,
as is apparently intended).
</p>

<p>
It does matter whether we escape first or perform substitutions first.
If we escape first then every code unit in an ill-formed sequence is
individually escaped as `\x{hex-digit-sequence}`.
So an ill-formed sequence of two `wchar_t` values will be escaped as
two `\x{...}` strings, which are then transcoded to UTF-8.
If we transcode (with substitutions first) then the entire
ill-formed sequence is replaced with a single replacement character,
which will then be escaped as `\x{fffd}`.
SG16 should be asked to confirm that escaping first is intended,
so that an escaped string shows the original invalid code units.
For a non-escaped string, we want the ill-formed sequence to be
formatted as &#xfffd;, which the proposed resolution tries to ensure.

Let `s` be <code>p.generic_string&lt;filesystem::path::value_type&gt;()</code>
if the `g` option is used, otherwise `p.native()`.
Writes `s into `ctx.out()`, adjusted according to the path-format-spec.
If `charT` is `char`, `path::value_type` is `wchar_t`,
and the literal encoding is UTF-8, then the

If `charT` and `path::value_type` are the same then no transcoding is performed.
