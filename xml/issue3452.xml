<title>Are views really supposed to have strict <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt> destruction?</title>

<p>
The second bullet of <sref ref="[range.view]"/> paragraph 3 says
"Examples of views are:[&hellip;]
A range type that holds its elements by <tt>shared_ptr</tt>
and shares ownership with all its copies".
That clearly does not have <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt> destruction in all cases.
However, that does seem like a useful type of view,
and is related to the discussions around the proposed <tt>std::generator</tt>.
</p>

<p>
What is the purpose of requiring <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt> destruction?
Would it still be achieved by weakening it slightly to something like
"If <i>N</i> copies and/or moves are made from a view that yields <i>M</i> values,
destroying all of them takes time proportional to at worst <tt>&#x1d4aa;(<i>N</i>+<i>M</i>)</tt>"?
This in particular prevents the <tt>&#x1d4aa;(<i>N</i>*<i>M</i>)</tt> case that I think the rules
are trying to prevent, while still allowing some more interesting types of views.
</p>

<p>
If instead we actually really do want strict <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt> destruction, 
then the example needs to be fixed.

This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4878">N4878</a>. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[range.view]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class T&gt;
  concept view =
    range&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp; movable&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp; default_initializable&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp; enable_view&lt;T&gt;;
</pre>
[&hellip;]
<blockquote>
<p>
-3- [<i>Example 1</i>: Examples of <tt>view</tt>s are:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(3.1) &mdash; A <tt>range</tt> type that wraps a pair of iterators.</p></li>
<li><p><del>(3.2) &mdash; A <tt>range</tt> type that holds its elements by shared_ptr and shares ownership with all its copies.</del></p></li>
<li><p>(3.3) &mdash; A <tt>range</tt> type that generates its elements on demand.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Most containers (Clause 22) are not views since destruction of the container destroys the elements, which cannot
be done in constant time. &mdash; <i>end example</i>]
