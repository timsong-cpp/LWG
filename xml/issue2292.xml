The C++14 CD has 25 sections including the phrase "X shall not
participate in overload resolution ...". Most of these uses are double
negatives, which are hard to interpret. "shall not ... unless" tends
to be the easiest to read, since the condition is true when the
function is available, but we also have a lot of "if X is not Y, then
Z shall not participate", which actually means "You can call Z if X is
Y." The current wording is also clumsy and long-winded. We should find
a better and more concise phrasing.
<p/>
As an initial proposal, I'd suggest using "X is enabled if and only if Y" in prose
and adding an "<i>Enabled If:</i> ..." element to <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/>.

Daniel:
<p/>
I suggest to name this new specification element for <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/>
as "<i>Template Constraints:</i>" instead, because the mentioned wording form was intentionally provided 
starting with LWG <iref ref="1237"/> to give implementations more freedom to realize the 
concrete constraints. Instead of the original <tt>std::enable_if</tt>-based specifications
we can use better forms of "SFINAE" constraints today and it eases the path to possible language-based
constraints in the future.

Apparently the adoption of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0788r3">P0788R3</a> at the Rapperswil 2018 meeting 
has resolved this issue by introduction of the new <i>Constraints:</i> element.
