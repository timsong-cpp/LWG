<title>Floating point <tt>from_chars</tt> API does not distinguish between overflow and underflow</title>

<p>
<tt>strtod()</tt> distinguishes between overflow and underflow by returning a value that is either 
very large or very small. Floating point <tt>from_chars</tt> does not currently offer any way for 
callers to distinguish these two cases.
<p/>
It would be beneficial if users could migrate from <tt>strtod()</tt> to <tt>from_chars</tt> without 
loss of functionality.
<p/>
I recommend that floating point <tt>from_chars</tt> use <tt>value</tt> as an overflow-vs-underflow 
reporting channel, in the same manner as <tt>strtod()</tt>.
<p/>
My proposed wording gives <tt>from_chars</tt> the same wide latitude that <tt>strtod()</tt> enjoys 
for handling underflow. A high-quality implementation would likely set <tt>ec == result_out_of_range</tt> 
for underflow only when the nearest representable <tt>float</tt> to the parsed value is a zero and 
the parsed mantissa was nonzero. In this case <tt>value</tt> would be set to (an appropriately-signed) zero. 
It is worth considering giving <tt>from_chars</tt> this more predictable behavior, if library writers 
feel they can provide this guarantee for all platforms. (I have a proof-of-concept integer-based 
implementation for IEEE doubles with this property.)

[&hellip;] Otherwise, the characters matching the pattern are interpreted as a representation
of a value of the type of <tt>value</tt>. The member <tt>ptr</tt> of the return value points 
to the first character not matching the pattern, or has the value <tt>last</tt> if all characters 
match. If the parsed value is not in the range representable by the type of <tt>value</tt>, 
<del><tt>value</tt> is unmodified and</del> the member <tt>ec</tt> of the return value is equal
to <tt>errc::result_out_of_range</tt>. Otherwise, <tt>value</tt> is set to the parsed value, 
after rounding according to <tt>round_to_nearest</tt> (<sref ref="[round.style]"/>), and the member 
<tt>ec</tt> is value-initialized.
