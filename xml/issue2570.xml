<p><b>Addresses: fund.ts.v2</b></p>
<p>
<sref ref="[meta.logical]"/>/2 and /5 impose the following requirement on the arguments of <tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every template type argument shall be usable as a base class and shall have a static data member value which is convertible to 
<tt>bool</tt>, is not hidden, and is unambiguously available in the type.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Since the requirement is unconditional, it applies even to type arguments whose instantiation is not required due to short circuiting. 
This seems contrary to the design intent, expressed in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0013r1.html">P0013R1</a>, 
that it is valid to write <tt>conjunction_v&lt;is_class&lt;T&gt;, is_foo&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt> even if instantiating 
<tt>is_foo&lt;T&gt;::value</tt> is ill-formed for non-class types.
