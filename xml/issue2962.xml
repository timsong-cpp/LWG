<title>Iterators of Containers of move-only types do not model <tt>InputIterator</tt></title>

<p>
In Table 95 in <sref ref="[input.iterators]"/>, it is specified that the expression <tt>*a</tt> returns <tt>reference</tt>, 
which must be convertible to <tt>value_type</tt>. This is not true for move-only types, which incidentally means that
<tt>std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt> does not possess even a lowly <tt>InputIterator</tt>, which is, of 
course, absurd.
<p/>
With the advent of concepts as first-class citizens in the language, getting this right as soon as possible is a priority.
<p/>
This issue seems to be similar to both LWG <iref ref="448"/> and LWG <iref ref="484"/>, but not the same.
<p/>
The proposed resolution stems from two considerations outlined below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Convertibility is too strong for all algorithms</b>
<p/>
No algorithm in the standard library requires convertibility to <tt>value_type</tt>. If algorithms require things that smell 
of that, they specify the assignment or constructibility flavor they need directly. I checked this by going through the 
specification of each and every one of them in <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt>, which highlighted 
several issues unrelated to this one. These issues are presented in <em>Algorithms with underspecified iterator requirements</em>
(LWG <iref ref="2963"/>).
<p/>
<b><tt>reference</tt> needs to be related to <tt>value_type</tt></b>
<p/>
Algorithms need this for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lifetime-extension: served as adequately by <tt>T const&amp;</tt> as by <tt>T</tt>. Also works for iterators that 
return by value. <tt>T&amp;&amp;</tt> also correctly binds to <tt>T const&amp;</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>passing to predicates: again, served adequately by <tt>T const&amp;</tt></p></li>
<li><p>writing to <tt>*result</tt>: not provided by the requirement anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>capture-by-copy: currently implicitly guaranteed, but unused in the standard library (always specified separately). 
A separate specification can always be made for algorithms that need to capture-by-copy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
We must give due consideration to code that so far required its inputs to be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> implicitly by 
requiring convertibility to <tt>T</tt>. This is done in the issue LWG <iref ref="2963"/>, 
which presents the results of a comb-through of <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> to find algorithms 
that have this requirement, but where it is not specified. While related issues have been identified, no algorithms seems 
to require more than <tt>T const&amp;</tt> convertibility without separately requiring convertibility to <tt>T</tt>.
<p/>
Since such code is already compiling today, relaxing this requirement does not break code.
<p/>
The only code this could possibly break is if, in a concept checking library, the <tt>InputIterator</tt> concept requirement 
on <tt>reference</tt> being convertible to <tt>value_type</tt> gets relaxed. Such a library, if it offered overloading based 
on most-specific modeled concept, could now, once fixed, resolve the call to a different algorithm, which could break user 
code that uses a hypothetical algorithm with a move-only container and was relying to select some other overload for move-only 
types based on the implicit <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> assertion provided by the iterator.
<p/>
In our internal concepts-checking library, we have had this issue "fixed" since the very beginning &mdash; move-only types 
were too important for our internal algorithms library, and also no algorithm in it seems to require something like 
<tt>Iterator::value_type x = *first</tt> without also requiring copy-constructibility anyway.
