<p>
In <sref ref="[time.zone.overview]"/>, only defaulted move constructor and move assignment operator for 
<tt>std::chrono::time_zone</tt> are shown, other constructors are said to be "unspecified additional constructors". 
Presumably the intent is that the default constructor is not declared (suppressed) and the copy constructor is 
implicitly deleted, but it is not clear if they are not "unspecified additional constructors" and hence 
implicitly specified.
<p/>
On the other hand, the defaulted definitions of move functions bring almost no specification, as no exposition 
only member is shown. So it is unspecified whether these functions are deleted, trivial, <tt>constexpr</tt>, 
or <tt>noexcept</tt>. Perhaps we want these functions to be non-deleted and <tt>noexcept</tt>, while triviality 
and <tt>constexpr</tt>-ness should be left unspecified.
