<p>
The move constructor and the move assignment operator of standard exception types are not covered by 
<sref ref="[exception]"/>/2, and thus it is currently effectively unspecified whether these move 
functions of <tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;void&gt;</tt> are <tt>noexcept</tt>. Furthermore, 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;void&gt;</tt> has protected special member functions, which overrides 
(or conflicts with?) the general rule in <sref ref="[exception]"/>/2.
<p/>
The primary template <tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> stores an <tt>E</tt> object, and copying 
the stored object may throw an exception. Is it intended that the copy functions of 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> are <tt>noexcept</tt> while those of <tt>E</tt> are not? 
When the copy happens because a <tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> is caught by value, if the 
copy constructor of <tt>E</tt> throws, <tt>std::terminate</tt> is called no matter whether that of 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> is <tt>noexcept</tt>. But 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;E&gt;</tt> may be copied/moved in other circumstances.
<p/>
I think the move constructor and the move assignment operator of a standard exception type should be 
specified to be public and <tt>noexcept</tt> when they exist, although sometimes whether they exist may be 
unspecified. And the move functions should also propagate the result of <tt>what()</tt> when the source 
and target have the same dynamic type, except that they can leave the result of <tt>what()</tt> from 
the source valid but unspecified.
<p/>
Related to this, <tt>std::expected&lt;T, E&gt;::value</tt> overloads are specified to throw 
<tt>std::bad_expected_access&lt;std::decay_t&lt;E&gt;&gt;</tt> when an <tt>E</tt> is contained. 
However, it seems that the copy constructor of <tt>std::bad_expected_access</tt> is implicitly 
deleted if <tt>E</tt> is move-only, so the <i>throw-expression</i> is ill-formed.
<p/>
Is it intended that <tt>std::expected&lt;T, E&gt;::value</tt> is ill-formed in such cases?
