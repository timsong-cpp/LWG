<p>
Trying to interpret the specification for <i>allocator-aware container</i>s, <sref ref="[container.alloc.reqmts]"/>.
<p/>
P1 establishes that <tt>std::array</tt> is <em>not</em> an allocator-aware container, but all other containers in
the standard are.
<p/>
P2 then adds vocabulary, with ruling that if a container type <tt>X</tt> is not allocator-aware then
the specification is as-if the allocator were <tt>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</tt>. I cannot find a specification
for allocator-aware, and do not believe we should treat this as a recursive definition, as
the only standard container that would be affected would be <tt>std::array</tt>, which absolutely
does not want to apply all the terms in this subclause.
<p/>
It looks like we might mean types that do not have everything specified by the first
sentence, such as an <tt>allocator_type</tt> member. Perhaps we want to say a container
type <tt>X</tt> is allocator-aware using allocator <tt>A</tt> if [&hellip;], and then that <tt>basic_string</tt> and
containers that are not otherwise allocator aware are are treated as-if they were
allocator-aware using <tt>std::allocator&lt;typename X::value_type&gt;</tt> (where <tt>value_type</tt>
is already guaranteed to exist by the basic container requirements).
