<p>
As a resolution to LWG <iref ref="3070"/>, in <tt>path lexically_relative(const path&amp; base) const</tt>, 
bullet 3.4 was added:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If: [&hellip;] any <i>filename</i> in <tt>relative_path()</tt> or <tt>base.relative_path()</tt> can be interpreted as 
a <i>root-name</i>, [&hellip;] returns <tt>path()</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This resolution was correct when we have really weird paths like <tt>abc\X:\c</tt>, but the MSVC standard library 
implementation treats UNC drive-relative paths as:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
\\?\C:\foo\bar = { <i>root-name</i> = \\?, <i>root-directory</i> = \, <i>relative-path</i> = C:\foo\bar }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If we were able to go back in time, we might have <tt><i>root-name</i> = \\?\C:</tt>, but we can't make that 
change at that point without silently breaking users; therefore, we believe it would be best to instead change 
<tt>lexically_relative()</tt> to work around this issue.
<p/>
There exists a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/2256">related github issue</a>.
<p/>
I don't yet have standard wording, but I think it would be reasonable to do something like:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If <tt>relative_path().has_root_path() &amp;&amp; base.relative_path().has_root_path()</tt>, and 
<tt>relative_path().root_path() == base.relative_path().root_path()</tt>, then 
<tt>return relative_path().lexically_relative(base.relative_path())</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
