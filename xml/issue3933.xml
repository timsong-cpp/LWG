<p>
In C++20 and earlier revisions, there are constructors taking two floating-point numbers by value in explicit 
specializations of <tt>std::complex</tt> for standard floating-point types. Since <paper num="P1467R9"/> has 
removed these explicit specializations, the corresponding constructor in the primary template that takes arguments 
by <tt>const T&amp;</tt> are used instead. As a result, the following program becomes ill-formed after the changes.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;complex&gt;

int main()
{
  volatile double x = 0.0;
  std::complex&lt;double&gt; z{x, x}; // <span  style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">ill-formed due to P1467R9 because const double&amp; cannot be bound to a volatile double lvalue</span>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Currently, libstdc++ has implemented complex specializations for extended floating-point types, but the corresponding 
constructors of these specializations takes two arguments by value, which is consistent with old specializations.
<p/>
It seems that it's unintended to change the signatures of these constructors. Perhaps we should restore the signatures for 
required specializations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Daniel:</b>
<p/>
Not only constructors are affected, but also all assignment operators taking the <tt>value_type</tt> as
parameter and I suggest that LEWG should have a look at this issue.
</p>

<note>2023-05-20; Daniel comments and suggests wording</note>
<p>
The wording below attempts to restore the exact previous behaviour: For all floating-point types the 
function parameter types are "by value" and for other types are "by const reference". The wording adds for 
specification purposes a dependency to the concept <tt>std::floating_point</tt>, but that doesn't mean that an 
implementation couldn't realize the required effects without usage of concepts or the <tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt>
header.
<p/>
Note that we have already precedence for similar cases where we later reintroduced concept requirements to library
parts where no concept dependencies had exist before, such as the <tt>iterator_traits</tt> specialization for
pointers (to object) or the additional constraints of <tt>set</tt>'s member function 
<tt>iterator erase(const_iterator position)</tt> or the constraint for <tt>reverse_iterator::operator-&gt;()</tt>,
just to name a few.
<p/>
One alternative approach could be to switch to "by-value" signatures only for the affected signatures. This could 
affect user-defined floating-point-like types such as those with an arbitrary precision, therefore I started with 
the most conservative approach restoring the original effects that was present in the
working draft <paper num="N4910"/> and older ones. It might we worth pointing out that the existing "setter"
functions <tt>imag</tt> and <tt>real</tt> have always been using "by-value" signatures for all specializations.
<p/>
There exists also the possible argument to close this issue as NAD based on the argument that all existing 
non-member operators taking a <tt>value_type</tt> argument had always been defined to use <tt>const T&amp;</tt>
as parameter (such as the <tt>operator@(const T&amp; lhs, const complex&lt;T&gt;&amp; rhs)</tt> forms).
<p/>
My main argument to solve this issue as shown below is based on the ground that the refactoring done by
<paper num="P1467R9"/> was mainly inspired to simplify the existing wording and to make it more easy to
integrate the addition of the extended floating-point types here, as quoted from 
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1467r9#complex">P1467R9 section 6.6. <tt>&lt;complex&gt;</tt></a>:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
[&hellip;] The explicit specializations of <tt>std::complex&lt;T&gt;</tt> are removed. The only differences between 
the explicit specializations was the explicit-ness of the constructors that take a complex number of a different type. 
</blockquote>
<p>
This issue has some overlap with LWG <iref ref="3934"/>, which suggests a yet missing specification for
the assignment operator taking the <tt>value_type</tt> as parameter.

This wording is relative to <paper num="N4950"/>.
