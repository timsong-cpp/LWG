<title>Should <tt>std::basic_osyncstream</tt>'s move assignment operator be <tt>noexcept</tt>?</title>

<p>
The synopsis of <tt>std::basic_osyncstream</tt> (<sref ref="[syncstream.osyncstream.overview]"/>) indicates that it's 
member functions behave as if it hold a <tt>std::basic_syncbuf</tt> as its subobject, and according to 
<sref ref="[functions.within.classes]"/>, <tt>std::basic_osyncstream</tt>'s move assignment operator should call 
<tt>std::basic_syncbuf</tt>'s move assignment operator.
<p/>
However, currently <tt>std::basic_osyncstream</tt>'s move assignment operator is <tt>noexcept</tt>, while 
<tt>std::basic_syncbuf</tt>'s is not. So when an exception is thrown from move assignment between <tt>std::basic_syncbuf</tt> 
objects, <tt>std::terminate</tt> should be called.
<p/>
It's clarified in LWG <iref ref="3498"/> that an exception can escape from <tt>std::basic_syncbuf</tt>'s move 
assignment operator. Is there any reason that an exception shouldn't escape from <tt>std::basic_osyncstream</tt>'s 
move assignment operator?

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[syncstream.osyncstream.overview]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace std {
  template&lt;class charT, class traits = char_traits&lt;charT&gt;, class Allocator = allocator&lt;charT&gt;&gt;
  class basic_osyncstream : public basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt; {
  public:
    [&hellip;]
    using syncbuf_type = basic_syncbuf&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;;
    [&hellip;]
    
    <i>// assignment</i>
    basic_osyncstream&amp; operator=(basic_osyncstream&amp;&amp;) <del>noexcept</del>;
