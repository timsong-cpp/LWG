<title>Allocators and <tt>volatile</tt>-qualified value types</title>

<p>
According to Table 27 &mdash; "Descriptive variable definitions" which is used to define the symbols used in the
allocator requirements table within <sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/> we have the following constraints for
the types <tt>T, U, C</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
any non-const object type (3.9)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This wording can be read to allow instead a <tt>volatile</tt>-qualified value type such as <tt>volatile int</tt>.
<p/>
The nearest-by way of fixing this would be to add "non-<tt>volatile</tt>" as additional constraint to this table
row.
<p/>
Another choice would be to think of requiring that allocators must be capable to handle any <tt><i>cv</i></tt>-qualified
value types. This would make all currently existing allocators non-conforming that can't handle <tt><i>cv</i></tt>-qualified 
value types, so I'm not suggesting to follow that route.
<p/>
A less radical step would be to allow <tt><i>cv</i></tt>-qualified types just for <tt>C</tt> (which is used to specify the
functions <tt>construct</tt> and <tt>destroy</tt> and where does not even exist any requirement that <tt>C</tt> actually 
is related to the value type of the allocator at all). This seemingly extension would be harmless because as of p8 of the
same sub-clause "An allocator may constrain the types on which it can be instantiated and the arguments for which its
<tt>construct</tt> member may be called."
<p/>
This differs from the requirements imposed on the types <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt> which both refer to value types of allocators.
<p/>
The proposed wording attempts to separate the two classes of requirements.

<li><p>Change <sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/> p8 as indicated: (This wording change is intended to
fix an obvious asymmetry between <tt>construct</tt> and <tt>destroy</tt> which I believe is not intended)</p>

<blockquote><p>
-8- An allocator may constrain the types on which it can be instantiated and the arguments for which its
<tt>construct</tt> <ins>or <tt>destroy</tt></ins> member<ins>s</ins> may be called. If a type cannot be 
used with a particular allocator, the allocator class or the call to <tt>construct</tt> <ins>or <tt>destroy</tt></ins> 
may fail to instantiate.

<p>
JW: say "cv-unqualified" instead?<br/>
JW: very nervous about allowing construct on const-types, because of the cast to (non-const) <tt>void*</tt><br/>
MA: should we just make the minimal fix?<br/>
STL: don't break <tt>C</tt> out for special treatment<br/>
New proposed resolution: just change "non-const" to "cv-unqualified". Keep addition of <tt>destroy</tt> later.

GR: It makes me nervous that someone at some point decided to not add "non-<tt>volatile</tt>".<br/> 
AM: That was over ten years ago. It was a deliberate, minuted choice to support <tt>volatile</tt>. We are now reversing that decision. 
It would be good to poll our vendors, none of which are in the room. This is a bit more work than we expect of a P0 issue.<br/> 
VV: libstdc++ and libc++ seem to support <tt>volatile</tt> template parameters for the standard allocator.<br/> 
AM: To clarify, the proposed resolution here would remove the requirement to support <tt>volatile</tt>. Implementations could still 
choose to support <tt>volatile</tt>.<br/>
DK: I'm happy to drop this and open a new issue in regard to the <tt>destroy</tt> member specification.<br/>
AM: I just think this is harder than a P0. Let's reprioritize.

<p>
The less controversial part of the issue related to constraints imposed on <tt>destroy</tt> has be handed over to the new 
issue <iref ref="2470"/>.
