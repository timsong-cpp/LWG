<p>
The standard doesn't say what it means if <tt>match_prev_avail</tt> is set. Table [tab:re.matchflag] says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>--first</tt> is a valid iterator position. When this flag is set the flags 
<tt>match_not_bol</tt> and <tt>match_not_bow</tt> shall be ignored by the regular expression
algorithms (<sref ref="[re.alg]"/>) and iterators (<sref ref="[re.iter]"/>).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
What difference does it make whether <tt>--first</tt> is a valid iterator position or not? 
<p/>
What behaviour is changed when it's a valid iterator position? The standard doesn't say anything else about that. 
<p/>
When do the regex algorithms care about <tt>--first</tt>?
</p>

<p>
Examples like <code>regex_match("xa"+1, regex("^a"), match_prev_avail)</code>
and <code>regex_match("xa"+1, regex("\\ba"), match_prev_avail)</code>
are presumably supposed to inspect the character at <code>--first</code>
to determine if there is a match.
The standard doesn't specify that <code>*--first</code> is ever inspected,
only that it's a valid character
(which is a useless guarantee if nothing looks at it).
