<p>
When <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is defined, <tt>assert</tt> must expand exactly to the token sequence <tt>((void)0)</tt>, with no 
whitespace (C99 &sect;7.2/1 and also C11 &sect;7.2/1). This is a lost opportunity to pass the condition along to the optimizer.
<p/>
The user may observe the token sequence using the stringize operator or discriminate it by making a matching <tt>#define</tt> 
directive. There is little chance of practical code doing such things. It's reasonable to allow any expansion that is a <tt>void</tt> 
expression with no side effects or semantic requirements, for example, an extension keyword or an attribute-specifier finagled 
into the context.
<p/>
Conforming optimizations would still be limited to treating the condition as hint, not a requirement. Nonconformance on this 
point is quite reasonable though, given user preferences. Anyway, it shouldn't depend on preprocessor quirks.
<p/>
As for current practice, Darwin OS <tt>&lt;assert.h&gt;</tt> provides a GCC-style compiler hint <tt>__builtin_expect</tt> but only in 
debug mode. Shouldn't release mode preserve hints?
<p/>

The corresponding resolution should take care not to conflict with the intention behind LWG <iref ref="2234"/>.

<note>2023-06-13, Varna; Status changed: New &rarr; NAD.</note>
<p>
Only observable by stringifying an assert expression anyway,
so arguably allowed by implementations anyway.
Needs a paper to make changes here, or incorporate into <paper num="P2884"/>.
