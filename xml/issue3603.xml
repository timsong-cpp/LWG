<p>
ECMAScript says that <tt>\0</tt> is an ordinary character and can be matched. POSIX says the opposite:
<p/>
"The interfaces specified in POSIX.1-2017 do not permit the inclusion of a NUL character in an RE or 
in the string to be matched. If during the operation of a standard utility a NUL is included in the 
text designated to be matched, that NUL may designate the end of the text string for the purposes of matching."
<p/>
So does that mean <tt>std::regex{"", 1, regex_constants::basic}</tt> should throw an exception?
<p/>
And <tt>std::regex_match(string{"a\0b", 3}, regex{"a.b"}, regex_constants::basic)</tt> should fail?
<p/>
The POSIX rule is because those interfaces are specified with NTBS arguments, so there's no way to 
distinguish <tt>"a\0b"</tt> and <tt>"a"</tt>. The C++ interfaces could allow it, but we never specify 
any divergence from POSIX, so presumably the rule still applies. Is that what was intended and is it 
what we want?
