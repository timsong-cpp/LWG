<p>
LWG <iref ref="117"/> fixed insertion of a `float` into an ostream by
requiring a cast to `double`. This gives a surprising result on RISC-V when
inserting a negative NaN, because RISC-V floating-point instructions do
not preserve the sign or payload of NaN values. This means that
<code>std::cout &lt;&lt; -std::numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::quiet_NaN()</code>
prints `"nan"` rather than `"-nan"` as most users probably expect.
</p>
<p>
11.3 section of the RISC-V ISA manual (20191213): 
</p>
<blockquote>
Except when otherwise stated, if the result of a floating-point operation
is NaN, it is the canonical NaN. The canonical NaN has a positive sign
and all significand bits clear except the MSB, a.k.a. the quiet bit.
For single-precision floating-point, this corresponds to the pattern
0x7fc00000.
</blockquote>
<p>
This is allowed by IEEE 754 (2019), as per section 6.3:
</p>
<blockquote>
When either an input or result is a NaN, this standard does not interpret
the sign of a NaN.
</blockquote>

<p>
So it is standard-conforming for <code>static_cast&lt;double&gt;(val)</code>
to lose the sign (and payload) of a NaN.
This might also affect Apple M1 chips, if they use the ARMv8 default-NaN mode.
</p>
<p>
The current wording does not permit an implementation to use something like
<code>std::copysign(static_cast&lt;double&gt;(val), std::signbit(val) ? -1.0 : +1.0)</code>
to restore the sign bit. Should this be allowed? Maybe we should say that it's
unspecified whether the cast to `double` preserves the sign of a NaN?
If not, should we add a note about the surprising behaviour?

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4981"/>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify <sref ref="[ostream.inserters.arithmetic]"/> as indicated:</p>
<blockquote>
-3-
When `val` is of type `float` the formatting conversion occurs as if
it performed the following code fragment:
<pre><code>
  bool failed = use_facet&lt;
    num_put&lt;charT, ostreambuf_iterator&lt;charT, traits&gt;&gt;
      >(getloc()).put(*this, *this, fill(),
        static_cast&lt;double&gt;(val)).failed();
</code></pre>
<ins>
[<i>Note ?</i>: When `val` is a NaN value, the conversion to `double`
can alter the sign and payload. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
