<p/>
What does it mean for (the contained) objects to be "equivalent"?
<p/>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Add definition (note that using <tt>operator==()</tt> involves complicated questions of overload 
resolution).
</p>

<note>2016-11-08, Jonathan comments and suggests wording</note>
<p>
We can rephrase the copy constructor in terms of equivalence to
construction from the contained object. We need to use in-place
construction to avoid recursion in the case where the contained object
is itself an any.
<p/>
For the move constructor we don't simply want to construct from the
contrained object, because when the contained object is stored in
dynamic memory we don't actually construct anything, we just transfer
ownership of a pointer.
