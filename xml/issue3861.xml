<p>
During work on some follow on proposals for C++26 (like the padded layouts and <tt>submdspan</tt>) we stumbled over an 
issue in the C++23 <tt>mdspan</tt> definition.
<p/>
If you have a <tt>layout_stride::mapping</tt> with just static extents, its default constructor will produce an inconsistent mapping. 
All its strides will be <tt>0</tt> but its extents are not. Thus the <tt>is_unique</tt> property is violated. We wrote a paper to 
fix this: <paper num="P2763R0"/>. We describe two options to fix it and state why we prefer one over the other, with proposed wording changes.
