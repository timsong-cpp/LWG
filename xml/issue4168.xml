Consider the motivating example from 
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2590r2.pdf">P2590R2: Explicit lifetime management</a>:

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<pre>
struct X { int a, b; };

X* make_x() {
  X* p = std::start_lifetime_as&lt;X&gt;(myMalloc(sizeof(struct X));
  p-&gt;a = 1;
  p-&gt;b = 2;
  return p;
}
</pre>

<p>
Assuming that `myMalloc` does not initialize the bytes of storage, this example has undefined behavior because 
the value of the resulting object of trivially copyable type `X` is determined as if by calling 
<tt>std::bit_cast&lt;X&gt;(a)</tt> for the implicitly-created object `a` of type `X` 
(<sref ref="[obj.lifetime]"/> paragraph 3), whose object representation is filled with indeterminate bytes 
obtained from `myMalloc`. Such a call to `std::bit_cast` has undefined behavior because `std::bit_cast` 
does not tolerate the creation of an `int` where bits in the value representation are indeterminate 
(<sref ref="[bit.cast]"/> paragraph 2), and such an `int` is the smallest enclosing object of some of the 
indeterminate bits.

This wording is relative to <paper num="N4993"/>.

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[obj.lifetime]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote class="note">
<p>
[<i>Drafting note</i>: The proposed resolution does not alter the behavior for erroneous bits. Therefore, 
a call to <tt>std::start_lifetime_as</tt> may have erroneous behavior when used on storage with indeterminate 
bits, despite not accessing that storage. An alternative resolution would be to produce objects whose value 
is erroneous.]
