<p>
The partial specialization <tt>expected&lt;T, E&gt; requires is_void&lt;T&gt;</tt> specified in 
<sref ref="[expected.void.general]"/> is missing some template parameter requirements that should 
have been copied from <sref ref="[expected.object.general]"/>. We should copy the pertinent 
requirements from the first two paragraphs of the latter subclause into new paragraphs in the first 
subclause (the pertinent requirement from the third paragraph is already present in 
<sref ref="[expected.void.general]"/>).

This wording is relative to <paper num="N4910"/>.

[<i>Drafting note:</i> There is some drive-by cleanup that I couldn't resist while touching this wording: (1) 
strike the redundant "suitably aligned" guarantee, (2) Don't repeat in prose that the exposition-only members 
are exposition-only.]
