<p>
Which encoding is intended by "the encoding used for <tt>charT</tt>"?  There are two candidates:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The associated execution character set as defined by <sref ref="[lex.charset]"/> p3 used to encode 
character and string literals (e.g., the "execution wide-character set" for <tt>wchar_t</tt>).</p></li>
<li><p>The locale dependent character set used by the <tt>std::locale ctype</tt> and <tt>codecvt</tt> 
facets as specified in <sref ref="[category.ctype]"/>, sometimes referred to as the 
"native character set".</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The behavior should not be dependent on <tt>locale</tt> and should therefore be specified in terms of 
the execution character sets.
<p/>
The execution character set is implementation defined and some implementations allow the choice of 
execution character set to be specified via a compiler option or determined based on the locale active 
when the compiler is run. For example, the Microsoft compiler, when run on a Windows system with regional 
language settings configured for "English (United States)", will use Windows-1252 for the execution 
character set, but allows this choice to be overridden with the <tt>/execution-charset</tt> compiler 
option. The Microsoft compiler might therefore use <tt>"us"</tt> by default, but <tt>"&micro;s"</tt> 
when invoked with the <tt>/execution-charset:utf-8</tt> or <tt>/execution-charset:.437</tt> options. 
In the latter two cases, the string contents would contain <tt>"\xb5\x73"</tt> and <tt>"\xe6\x73"</tt> 
respectively (Unicode and Windows code page 437 map &micro; (U+00B5, MICRO SIGN) to different code points).
<p/>
This resolution relies on the character set for the locale used at run-time being compatible with the 
execution character set if the produced string is to be displayed correctly when written to a terminal 
or console. This is a typical requirement for character and string literals but is more strongly 
relevant for this issue since &micro; lacks representation in many character sets. Additionally, if the 
stream is imbued with a <tt>std::codecvt</tt> facet, the facet must provide appropriate conversion 
support for behavior to be well defined.
