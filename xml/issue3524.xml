<title>Unimplementable narrowing and evaluation order requirements for range adaptors</title>

<p>
The specification of various range factory and adaptor objects generally says that some function call 
expression on them is expression-equivalent to an expression that performs list-initialization or in 
some cases a comma expression. This imposes evaluation order requirements that are unlikely to be 
intended and sometimes outright contradictory. For example, <sref ref="[range.drop.overview]"/> says 
that <tt>views::drop(E, F)</tt> is expression-equivalent to "<tt>((void) F, decay-copy(E))</tt>" in 
one case, and <tt>drop_view{E, F}</tt> in another. The first expression requires <tt>F</tt> to be 
sequenced before <tt>E</tt>, while the second expression requires <tt>E</tt> to be sequenced before 
<tt>F</tt>. They can't both hold in the absence of high levels of compiler magic.
<p/>
Additionally, because the core language narrowing check in list-initialization considers the value of 
constant expressions, "expression-equivalent" also requires the constantness to be propagated. For 
example, given a range <tt>E</tt> whose <tt>difference_type</tt> is <tt>int32_t</tt>, 
<tt>views::drop(E, int64_t())</tt> is required to work, but <tt>int64_t l = 0; views::drop(E, l)</tt> 
is required to be ill-formed. This seems unlikely to be the intent either.
