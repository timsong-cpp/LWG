<p>
According to the current wording,
<tt>std::is_constructible&lt;int[], int&gt;</tt>
should be true, because the preconditions are met
(all types are complete types or unbounded arrays)
and the variable definition is well-formed since C++20:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
using T = int[];
T t(declval&lt;int&gt;()); <i>// equiv. to</i> int t[] = {1};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
However, this doesn't construct an object of type <tt>int[]</tt>
because it deduces the array bound from the initializers,
and so constructs <tt>int[1]</tt>, which is not the type being asked about.
It seems more logical for the trait to give a false result
for an unbounded array, because it's an incomplete type,
and no <tt>int[]</tt> can ever be constructed.
</p>

<p>
On the reflector Tim Song noted:
</p>
<blockquote>
On the other hand, the result is something to which an <tt>int(&amp;)[]</tt>
can be bound directly thanks to another C++20 change,
so a lot of things might Just Work (for some definition of "Work")
despite the type difference.
</blockquote>

<p>
This seems to me a reasonable rationale for
<tt>is_constructible&lt;int(&amp;&amp;)[], int&gt;</tt>
to be true (which it is today),
but not for <tt>int[]</tt>.
</p>

Peter Dimov replied:
</p>
<blockquote>
Placement new, which is often the way to construct we're interested in,
is not going to work even for <tt>T[2]</tt>.
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
using T2 = int[2];
T2 x;
new(x) T2(1, 2); <i>// ill-formed</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We need to decide what behaviour we want here.
Do we just want <tt>is_constructible</tt>
to reflect the <tt>T(declval&lt;Args...&gt;);</tt> construct
as currently specified in <sref ref="[meta.unary.prop]"/> p8,
or do we want to give a more useful/meaningful answer here?
</p>

<p>
Should we revisit <sref ref="[meta.unary.prop]"/> p8
in the light of parenthesized aggregate init,
so that <tt>is_constructible&lt;T[], T&gt;</tt>
and <tt>is_constructible&lt;T[1], T&gt;</tt> are false?
</p>

<p>
There may be some interaction with LWG <iref ref="3436"/>.
