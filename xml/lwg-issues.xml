  <p>The purpose of this document is to record the status of issues
  which have come before the Library Working Group (LWG) of the INCITS PL22.16
  and ISO WG21 C++ Standards Committee. Issues represent
  potential defects in the ISO/IEC IS 14882:2014(E) document.  
  </p>

  <p>This document contains only library issues which are actively being
  considered by the Library Working Group, i.e., issues which have a
  status of <a href="lwg-active.html#New">New</a>, <a href="lwg-active.html#Open">Open</a>, 
  <a href="lwg-active.html#Ready">Ready</a>, or <a href="lwg-active.html#Review">Review</a>.
  See <a href="lwg-defects.html">Library Defect Reports List</a> for issues considered defects
  and <a href="lwg-closed.html">Library Closed Issues List</a> for issues considered closed.</p>

  <p>The issues in these lists are not necessarily formal ISO Defect
  Reports (DR's). While some issues will eventually be elevated to
  official Defect Report status, other issues will be disposed of in
  other ways. See <a href="#Status">Issue Status</a>.</p>

  <p>Prior to Revision 14, library issues lists existed in two slightly
  different versions; a Committee Version and a Public
  Version. Beginning with Revision 14 the two versions were combined
  into a single version.</p>

  <p>This document includes <i>[bracketed italicized notes]</i> as a
  reminder to the LWG of current progress on issues. Such notes are
  strictly unofficial and should be read with caution as they may be
  incomplete or incorrect. Be aware that LWG support for a particular
  resolution can quickly change if new viewpoints or killer examples are
  presented in subsequent discussions.</p>

  <p>For the most current official version of this document see 
  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/</a>.
  Requests for further information about this document should include
  the document number above, reference ISO/IEC 14882:2014(E), and be
  submitted to Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), 1250 Eye
  Street NW, Washington, DC 20005.</p>

  <p>Public information as to how to obtain a copy of the C++ Standard,
  join the standards committee, submit an issue, or comment on an issue
  can be found in the comp.std.c++ FAQ.

<p><a name="submit_issue"></a><b>How to submit an issue</b></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
<li><a name="submit_issue_A"></a>
Mail your issue to the author of this list.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_B"></a>
Specify a short descriptive title.  If you fail to do so, the subject line of your
mail will be used as the issue title.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_C"></a>
If the "From" on your email is not the name you wish to appear as issue submitter,
then specify issue submitter.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_D"></a>
Provide a brief discussion of the problem you wish to correct.  Refer to the latest
working draft or standard using [section.tag] and paragraph numbers where appropriate.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_E"></a>
Provide proposed wording.  This should indicate exactly how you want the standard
to be changed.  General solution statements belong in the discussion area.  This
area contains very clear and specific directions on how to modify the current
draft.  If you are not sure how to word a solution, you may omit this part.
But your chances of a successful issue greatly increase if you attempt wording.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_F"></a>
It is not necessary for you to use html markup.  However, if you want to, you can
&lt;ins&gt;<ins>insert text like this</ins>&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;<del>delete text like
this</del>&lt;/del&gt;.  The only strict requirement is to communicate clearly to
the list maintainer exactly how you want your issue to look.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_G"></a>
It is not necessary for you to specify other html font/formatting
mark-up, but if you do the list maintainer will attempt to respect your
formatting wishes (as described by html markup, or other common idioms).
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_H"></a>
It is not necessary for you to specify open date or last modified date (the date
of your mail will be used).
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_I"></a>
It is not necessary for you to cross reference other issues, but you can if you
like.  You do not need to form the hyperlinks when you do, the list maintainer will
take care of that.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_J"></a>
One issue per email is best.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_K"></a>
Between the time you submit the issue, and the next mailing deadline
(date at the top of the Revision History), you <em>own</em> this issue. 
You control the content, the stuff that is right, the stuff that is
wrong, the format, the misspellings, etc.  You can even make the issue
disappear if you want.  Just let the list maintainer know how you want
it to look, and he will try his best to accommodate you.  After the
issue appears in an official mailing, you no longer enjoy exclusive
ownership of it.

<statuses>
  <p>Issues reported to the LWG transition through a variety of statuses,
  indicating their progress towards a resolution.  Typically, most issues
  will flow through the following stages.
  </p>

  <p><b><a name="New">New</a></b> - The issue has not yet been
  reviewed by the LWG. Any <b>Proposed Resolution</b> is purely a
  suggestion from the issue submitter, and should not be construed as
  the view of LWG.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Open">Open</a></b> - The LWG has discussed the issue
  but is not yet ready to move the issue forward. There are several
  possible reasons for open status:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Consensus may have not yet have been reached as to how to deal
            with the issue.</li>
        <li>Informal consensus may have been reached, but the LWG awaits
            exact <b>Proposed Resolution</b> wording for review.</li>
        <li>The LWG wishes to consult additional technical experts before
            proceeding.</li>
        <li>The issue may require further study.</li>
     </ul>

  <p>A <b>Proposed Resolution</b> for an open issue is still not be
  construed as the view of LWG. Comments on the current state of
  discussions are often given at the end of open issues in an italic
  font. Such comments are for information only and should not be given
  undue importance.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Review">Review</a></b> - Exact wording of a
  <b>Proposed Resolution</b> is now available for review on an issue
  for which the LWG previously reached informal consensus.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Ready">Ready</a></b> - The LWG has reached consensus
  that the issue is a defect in the Standard, the <b>Proposed
  Resolution</b> is correct, and the issue is ready to forward to the
  full committee for further action as a Defect Report (DR).</p>

  <p>Typically, an issue must have a proposed resolution in the currently
  published issues list, whose wording does not change during LWG review, to
  move to the Ready status.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Voting">Voting</a></b> - This status should not be seen
  in a published issues list, but is a marker for use during meetings to
  indicate an issues was Ready in the pre-meeting mailing, the <b>Proposed
  Resolution</b> is correct, and the issue will be offered to the working
  group at the end of the current meeting to apply to the current working
  paper (WP) or to close in some other appropriate manner.  This easily
  distinguishes such issues from those moving to Ready status during the
  meeting itself, that should not be forwarded until the next meeting.  If
  the issue does not move forward, it should fall back to one of the other
  open states before the next list is published.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Immediate">Immediate</a></b> - This status should not be
  seen in a published issues list, but is a marker for use during meetings
  to indicate an issues was not Ready in the pre-meeting mailing, but the
  <b>Proposed Resolution</b> is correct, and the issue will be offered to
  the working group at the end of the current meeting to apply to the
  current working paper (WP) or to close in some other appropriate manner.
  This status is used only rarely, typically for fixes that are both small
  and obvious, and usually within a meeting of the expected publication of
  a revised standard.  If the issue does not move forward, it should fall
  back to one of the other open states before the next list is published.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are a few ways to categorise and issue that remains
  open to a resolution within the library, but is not actively being worked
  on.
  </p>

  <p><b><a name="Deferred">Deferred</a></b> - The LWG has discussed the issue,
  is not yet ready to move the issue forward, but neither does it deem the
  issue significant enough to delay publishing a standard or Technical Report.
  A typical deferred issue would be seeking to clarify wording that might be
  technically correct, but easily mis-read.</p>

  <p>A <b>Proposed Resolution</b> for a deferred issue is still not be
  construed as the view of LWG. Comments on the current state of
  discussions are often given at the end of open issues in an italic
  font. Such comments are for information only and should not be given
  undue importance.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Core">Core</a></b> - The LWG has discussed the issue, and feels
  that some key part of resolving the issue is better handled by a cleanup of
  the language in the Core part of the standard.  The issue is passed to the Core
  Working Group, which should ideally open a corresponding issue that can be
  linked from the library issue.  Such issues will be revisitted after Core have
  made (or declined to make) any changes.
  </p>

  <p><b><a name="EWG">EWG</a></b> - The LWG has discussed the issue, and wonder
  that some key part of resolving the issue is better handled by some (hopefully
  small) extension to the language.  The issue is passed to the Evolution Working
  Group, which should ideally open a corresponding issue that can be linked from
  the library issue.  Such issues will be revisitted after Evoltion have made (or
  declined to make) any recommendations.  Positive recommendations from EWG will
  often mean the issue transition to <i>Core</i> status while we wait for some
  proposed new feature to land in the working paper.
  </p>

  <p><b><a name="LEWG">LEWG</a></b> - The LWG has discussed the issue, and deemd
  the issue is either an extension, however small, or changes the library design
  in some fundamental way, and so has delegated the initial work to the Library
  Evolution Working Group.
  </p>

  <p>Ultimately, all issues should reach closure with one of the following statuses.
  </p>

  <p><b><a name="DR">DR</a></b> - (Defect Report) - The full WG21/PL22.16
  committee has voted to forward the issue to the Project Editor to be
  processed as a Potential Defect Report. The Project Editor reviews
  the issue, and then forwards it to the WG21 Convenor, who returns it
  to the full committee for final disposition. This issues list
  accords the status of DR to all these Defect Reports regardless of
  where they are in that process.</p>

  <p><b><a name="WP">WP</a></b> - (Working Paper) - The proposed resolution has not been
  accepted as a Technical Corrigendum, but the full WG21/PL22.16 committee has voted to
  apply the Defect Report's Proposed Resolution to the working paper.</p>

  <p><b><a name="C++14">C++14</a></b> - (C++ Standard, as revised for 2014) - The full
  WG21/PL22.16 committee has voted to accept the Defect Report's Proposed Resolution into
  the published 2014 revision to the C++ standard, ISO/IEC IS 14882:2014(E).</p>

   <p><b><a name="C++11">C++11</a></b> - (C++ Standard, as revised for 2011) - The full
  WG21/PL22.16 committee has voted to accept the Defect Report's Proposed Resolution into
  the published 2011 revision to the C++ standard, ISO/IEC IS 14882:2011(E).</p>

   <p><b><a name="CD1">CD1</a></b> - (Committee Draft 2008) - The full
  WG21/PL22.16 committee has voted to accept the Defect Report's Proposed
  Resolution into the Fall 2008 Committee Draft.</p>

  <p><b><a name="TC1">TC1</a></b> - (Technical Corrigenda 1) - The full
  WG21/PL22.16 committee has voted to accept the Defect Report's Proposed
  Resolution as a Technical Corrigenda.  Action on this issue is thus
  complete and no further action is possible under ISO rules.</p>

  <p><b><a name="TRDec">TRDec</a></b> - (Decimal TR defect) - The LWG has voted to
  accept the Defect Report's Proposed Resolution into the Decimal TR.  Action on this
  issue is thus complete and no further action is expected.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Resolved">Resolved</a></b> - The LWG has reached consensus
  that the issue is a defect in the Standard, but the resolution adopted to
  resolve the issue came via some other mechanism than this issue in the
  list - typically by applying a formal paper, occasionally as a side effect
  of consolidating several interacting issue resolutions into a single issue.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Dup">Dup</a></b> - The LWG has reached consensus that
  the issue is a duplicate of another issue, and will not be further
  dealt with. A <b>Rationale</b> identifies the duplicated issue's
  issue number.</p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD">NAD</a></b> - The LWG has reached consensus that
  the issue is not a defect in the Standard.</p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD Editorial">NAD Editorial</a></b> - The LWG has reached consensus that
  the issue can either be handled editorially, or is handled by a paper (usually
  linked to in the rationale).</p>

  <p><b>Tentatively</b> - This is a <i>status qualifier</i>.  The issue has
  been reviewed online, or at an unofficial meeting, but not in an official meeting, and
  some support has been formed for the qualified status.  Tentatively qualified issues may
  be moved to the unqualified status and forwarded to full committee (if Ready) within the
  same meeting.  Unlike Ready issues, Tentatively Ready issues will be reviewed in
  subcommittee prior to forwarding to full committee.  When a status is qualified with
  Tentatively, the issue is still considered active.</p>

  <p><b>Pending</b> - This is a <i>status qualifier</i>.  When prepended to a status this
  indicates the issue has been processed by the committee, and a decision has been made to
  move the issue to the associated unqualified status.  However for logistical reasons the
  indicated outcome of the issue has not yet appeared in the latest working paper.</p>

  <p>The following statuses have been retired, but may show up on older issues lists.</p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD Future">NAD Future</a></b> - In addition to the regular status, the
  LWG believes that this issue should be revisited at the next revision of the standard.
  That is now an ongoing task managed by the Library Evolution Working Group, and most
  issues in this status were reopended with the status <a href="#NAD Editorial">LEWG</a>.
  </p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD Concepts">NAD Concepts</a></b> - This status reflects an evolution
  of the language during the development of C++11, where a new feature entered the
  language, called <i>concepts</i>, that fundamentally changed the way templates would
  be specified and written.  While this language feature was removed towards the end of
  the C++11 project, there is a clear intent to revisit this part of the language design.
  During that development, a number of issues were opened against the updated library
  related to use of that feature, or requesting fixes that would require explicit use of
  the concepts feature.  All such issues have been closed with this status, and may be
  revisitted should this or a similar language feature return for a future standard.</p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD Arrays">NAD Arrays</a></b> - This status reflects an evolution
  of the language during the development of C++14/17, where work on a Technical 
  Specification, called the <i>Arrays TS</i> was begun. In early 2016, this work was
  abandoned, and the work item was officially withdrawn.  During development of the TS,
  a number of issues were opened the features in the TS. All such issues have been closed
  with this status, and may be revisitted should this or a similar language feature
  return for a future standard.</p>

  <p>Issues are always given the status of <a href="lwg-active.html#New">New</a> when
  they first appear on the issues list. They may progress to
  <a href="lwg-active.html#Open">Open</a> or <a href="lwg-active.html#Review">Review</a>
  while the LWG is actively working on them. When the LWG has reached consensus on
  the disposition of an issue, the status will then change to
  <a href="lwg-active.html#Dup">Dup</a>, <a href="lwg-active.html#NAD">NAD</a>, or
  <a href="lwg-active.html#Ready">Ready</a> as appropriate.  Once the full PL22.16 committee
  votes to forward Ready issues to the Project Editor, they are given the status of Defect
  Report (<a href="lwg-active.html#DR">DR</a>). These in turn may become the basis for
  Technical Corrigenda (<a href="lwg-active.html#TC1">TC1</a>), an updated standard
  (<a href="lwg-defects.html#C++11">C++11</a>, <a href="lwg-defects.html#C++14">C++14</a>),
  or are closed without action other than a Record of Response
  (<a href="lwg-active.html#Resolved">Resolved</a>) where the desired effect has already
  been achieved by some other process.  The intent of this LWG process is that only issues
  which are truly defects in the Standard move to the formal ISO DR status.
