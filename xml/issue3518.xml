<sref ref="[char.traits.require]"/> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<tt>X</tt> denotes a traits class defining types and functions for the character container type 
<tt>C</tt> [&hellip;] Operations on <tt>X</tt> shall not throw exceptions.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should be clarified what "operations on <tt>X</tt>" means. For example, in <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D95251">this 
patch</a>, there was some confusion around the exact meaning of "operations on <tt>X</tt>". If it refers to 
the expressions specified in [tab:char.traits.req] or if it refers to all member functions of <tt>X</tt>, 
this should be worded in some clearer way.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4878">N4878</a>. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[char.traits.require]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- In Table [tab:char.traits.req], <tt>X</tt> denotes a traits class defining types and functions for the 
character container type <tt>C</tt>; [&hellip;] <del>Operations on <tt>X</tt> shall not throw exceptions</del><ins>No
expression which is part of the character traits requirements specified in this subclause shall exit via
an exception</ins>.
</p>
