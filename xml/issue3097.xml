[stringbuf.virtuals]/10 says that <tt>newoff</tt> might be calculated from <tt>xnext - xbegin</tt>, 
or from <tt>high_mark - xbegin</tt>. After <tt>newoff</tt> is calculated, it does the null pointer 
check against and zero offset check. However, that means the effects may have already done 
<tt>nullptr -</tt> non-<tt>nullptr</tt>, or non-<tt>nullptr - nullptr</tt>, which [expr.add]/5 says 
is undefined behavior.
<p/>
Moreover, the attempt at avoiding this problem only tests <tt>newoff</tt>, not the value actually used 
which is <tt>newoff + off</tt>. For example, <tt>buf.seekoff(100, ios_base::beg, ios_base::out)</tt> 
on a read-only <tt>streambuf</tt> would try to assign <tt>pptr() + newoff + off to pptr()</tt>, but 
<tt>pptr()</tt> may have been <tt>nullptr</tt>, giving <tt>nullptr + 0 + 100</tt> which triggers UB. 
(Perhaps the "refers to an uninitialized character" bit protects that though).
<p/>
Last, the <i>Returns:</i> element says that it returns <tt>newoff</tt>, but then also says it returns 
the resulting stream position, which should be something like <tt>newoff + off</tt>. (I checked libc++ 
and MSVC++ and we both return <tt>newoff + off</tt>)
<p/>
We probably want to resolve that by renaming the value that comes out of Table 108 to something like 
"<tt>basis</tt>" and make "<tt>newoff</tt>" actually be the new offset instead of the starting offset.
