Due to an incompletely implemented change in Kona, some of the size_type deduction guides say something like:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A <tt>size_type</tt> parameter type in an <tt>unordered_set</tt> deduction guide refers to the <tt>size_type</tt> 
member type of the primary <tt>unordered_set</tt> template
</p></blockquote>
<p>
while others say
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A <tt>size_type</tt> parameter type in an <tt>unordered_map</tt> deduction guide refers to the <tt>size_type</tt> 
member type of the type deduced by the deduction guide.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Clearly they should both be the same. My recollection is that the intent of the committee was to change them all 
to be the latter. Note, however, that this issue may be mooted if the suggestions in the upcoming 
<a href="https://wg21.link/p0433r3">P0433R3</a> paper are adopted as a DR in Toronto.
