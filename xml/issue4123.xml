<p>
The spec for `deque::erase` talks about a exception
"thrown by the assignment operator of `T`" but it's unclear which
assignment operator this means.
Arguably, this is fine because it means "the assignment operator that
is used when repositioning the remaining elements".
However, `deque::append_range`, `vector::append_range`, `vector::erase`,
`inplace_vector::append_range`, and `inplace_vector::erase` talk about
"the assignment operator or move assignment operator" which is just odd.
In C++03 this just said "the assignment operator" and move semantics
added "or the move assignment operator" but we could improve it.
</p>

<p>
What we should talk about is "an assignment operator", or "the assignment
operator selected by overload resolution for the assignment expressions
performed by the operation", or something like that.
</p>

<p>
This is potentially a bigger issue than just assignment:
for `append_range` we say
"If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor,
move constructor, assignment operator, or move assignment operator [...]"
and there's no guarantee that the constructor used for initializing a
<i>Cpp17CopyInsertable</i> type is a copy constructor or move constructor.
It could be some templated constructor that is a better match than any
of the special member functions.
