<p><tt>basic_string::assign(size_type n, charT c);</tt> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to <tt>assign(basic_string(n, c))</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This requires that a new <tt>basic_string</tt> is constructed, using a
default-constructed allocator, potentially allocating memory, and then
that new string is copy-assigned to <tt>*this</tt>, potentially propagating the
allocator. This must be done even if <tt>this-&gt;capacity() &gt; n</tt>,
because memory allocation and allocator propagation are observable side
effects. If the allocator doesn't propagate and isn't equal to
<tt>this-&gt;get_allocator()</tt> then a second allocation may be required. This
can't be right; it won't even compile if the allocator isn't default
constructible.
<p/>
<tt>basic_string::assign(InputIterator first, InputIterator last)</tt> has a
similar problem, even if the iterators are random access and
<tt>this-&gt;capacity() &gt; distance(first, last)</tt>.
<p/>
<tt>basic_string::assign(std::initializer_list&lt;charT&gt;</tt> doesn't say
"Equivalent to" so maybe it's OK to not allocate anything if the list
fits in the existing capacity.
<p/>
<tt>basic_string::append(size_type, charT)</tt> and
<tt>basic_string::append(InputIterator, InputIterator)</tt> have the same
problem, although they don't propagate the allocator, but still
require at least one, maybe two allocations.
<p/>
A partial fix would be to ensure all the temporaries are constructed
with <tt>get_allocator()</tt> so that they don't require default constructible
allocators, and so propagation won't alter allocators. The problem of
observable side effects is still present (the temporary might need to
allocate memory, even if <tt>this-&gt;capacity()</tt> is large) but arguably it's
unspecified when construction allocates, to allow for small-string
optimisations.

<p>Set priority to 3. Thomas to argue on reflector that this is NAD.</p>

<p>
Thomas and Jonathan remark that LWG <iref ref="2788"/> fixed most cases except
the allocator respectance and provide wording for this:
