<p>
Currently MSVC STL implements <paper num="P2602R2"/> and <paper num="P2609R3"/> in C++20 mode 
as if they were defect reports. However, since <paper num="P2387R3"/> and <paper num="P2494R2"/>, 
which are possibly considered pure functionality extensions in C++23, also bump <tt>__cpp_lib_ranges</tt>, 
it's impossible to detect the status of P2602R2 and P2609R3 in C++20 mode (see 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/pull/3486#discussion_r1112178364">the discussion in MSVC STL repo</a>).
<p/>
This may be a non-defect as P2602R2 and P2609R3 are not officially DRs. However, if these papers 
(including upcoming <paper num="P2538R1"/>) are expected to be implemented in C++20 modes, it seems better 
to establish another feature-test macro (e.g., <tt>__cpp_lib_ranges_mechanism</tt>) for them.
