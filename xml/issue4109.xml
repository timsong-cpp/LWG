As pointed out in LWG issue <iref ref="2326"/> (closed as NAD) and 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1czwa5h/is_instantiating_stduniform_int_distributionuint8/">on reddit</a>, 
instantiating e.g. <tt>uniform_int_distribution&lt;uint8_t&gt;</tt> is undefined behavior 
because of the requirement <sref ref="[rand.req.genl]"/> bullet (1.5):

This is, in my opinion, a defect; such uses should either be rejected
at compile time (made ill-formed), or permitted (as 2326 proposes.)
<p/>
UB here has undesirable safety implications, because it's possible to
write code that produces a random, or a seemingly random, sequence
of <tt>uint8_t</tt> numbers on platform A, but an arbitrarily non-random
sequence on platform B (e.g. all zeroes.)
<p/>
If that sequence is then used in e.g. a cryptographic algorithm, bad
things will happen on platform B, and the tests on platform A won't
catch the issue.

I think that all violations of the bullets <sref ref="[rand.req.genl]"/> (1.4), (1.5), and (1.6)
are missed opportunities of <i>Mandates</i> (That is: Make the program ill-formed), because
they can be all checked (easily) at compile-time, regardless whether we agree on
the question to support <tt>int8_t</tt>/<tt>uint8_t</tt> (Violations of (1.1), (1.2), and (1.3)
still have to be remain undefined because of additional runtime requirements imposed).
<p/>
Given that I also think that we should consider to either normatively extend all of (1.4), (1.5), 
and (1.6) to corresponding <i>extended floating point</i> types and <i>extended (unsigned) integer types</i>, 
or to the minimum make these extended types conditionally-supported with implementation-defined 
semantics (A word of power that is used at several places).
