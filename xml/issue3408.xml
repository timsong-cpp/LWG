<p>
LWG <iref ref="3291"/> makes changes to <tt>iota_view</tt> so that it no longer falsely claims
it's a C++17 forward iterator. A side effect of this change is that the <tt>counted_iterator</tt> 
of an <tt>iota_view</tt> can no longer model <tt>forward_iterator</tt>, no matter what the 
properties of the underlying <tt>weakly_incrementable</tt> type are. For example, the following 
snippet is ill-formed after LWG 3291:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto v = views::iota(0);
auto i = counted_iterator{v.begin(), 5};
static_assert(random_access_iterator&lt;decltype(i)&gt;); // fails after LWG 3291
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The problem seems to be that <tt>counted_iterator</tt> populates its <tt>iterator_traits</tt> 
but it does not specify its <tt>iterator_concept</tt>, so we fall back to looking at its 
<tt>iterator_category</tt> to determine its C++20 iterator-ness. It seems 
<tt>counted_iterator</tt> should specify its <tt>iterator_concept</tt> appropriately based on 
the <tt>iterator_concept</tt> of the iterator it wraps.
