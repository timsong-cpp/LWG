<title>What should <tt>create_directories</tt> do when <tt>p</tt> already exists but is not a directory?</title>

<p>
The <tt>create_directory</tt> and <tt>create_directories</tt> functions have a postcondition that says
<tt>is_directory(p)</tt>, but it is unclear how they are supposed to provide this. Both of their effects say that
they create a directory and return whether it was actually created. It is possible to interpret this as "if
creation fails due to the path already existing, issue another system call to see if the path is a directory,
and change the result if so" &mdash; but it seems unfortunate to require both Windows and POSIX to issue more
system calls in this case.
<p/>
In email discussion Davis Herring and Billy O'Neal discussed this issue and agreed that this was probably
unintentional. Special thanks for Jonathan Wakely's suggested change to <tt>create_directories</tt>'
<em>Returns</em> clause.
