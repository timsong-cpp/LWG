<title>Time formatters should not be locale sensitive by default</title>

In <sref ref="[time.format]"/> it is specified:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Some of the conversion specifiers depend on the locale that is passed to the formatting function if the latter takes one, or the global locale otherwise.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is not consistent with the format design after the adoption of <a href="https://wg21.link/p1892">P1892</a>. In 
<sref ref="[format.string.std]"/> we say:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
When the <tt>L</tt> option is used, the form used for the conversion is called the <i>locale-specific</i> form. The 
<tt>L</tt> option is only valid for arithmetic types, and its effect depends upon the type.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This has two issues: First, it is inconsistent.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
format("{}, 0.0"); // locale independent
format("{:L}", 0.0); // use locale
format("{:%r}, some_time); // use globale locale
format("{:%rL}, some_time); // error
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
And second it perpetuates the issues <a href="https://wg21.link/p1892">P1892</a> intended to solve.
It is likely that this inconsistency resulted from both papers being in flight around the same time.
<p/>
The <tt>L</tt> option should be used and consistent with floating point. We suggest using the C locale 
which is the non-locale locale, see also 
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/basedefs/xbd_chap07.html">here</a>.

Priority set to 2.
This will be resolved by <a href="https://wg21.link/P2372">P2373</a>.
Tim noted: "P1892 didn't change format's ignore-locale-by-default design,
so that paper being in flight at the same time as P1361 cannot explain why
the latter is locale-sensitive-by-default."

-2- Each conversion specifier <i>conversion-spec</i> is replaced by appropriate characters as described in Table 
[tab:time.format.spec]; the formats specified in ISO 8601:2004 shall be used where so described. Some of the conversion specifiers
depend on <del>the locale that is passed to the formatting function if the latter takes one, or the global locale
otherwise</del><ins>a locale. If the <tt>L</tt> option is used, that locale is the locale that is passed to 
the formatting function if the latter takes one, or the global locale otherwise. If the <tt>L</tt> option is not used, 
that locale is the <tt>"C"</tt> locale</ins>. If the formatted object does not contain the information the 
conversion specifier refers to, an exception of type <tt>format_error</tt> is thrown.
