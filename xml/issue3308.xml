<p>
It seems incorrect that a container would invalidate anything as a result of being asked to erase 0 elements. 
This came up in a recent customer bug report against Visual Studio, where given a <tt>vector v</tt>, 
<tt>v.erase(v.begin(), v.begin())</tt> triggered a self-assignment of all the elements in the vector. 
<p/>
<tt>deque</tt> has language enumerating erasures of the first and last element which invalidate fewer 
iterators, and a fallback that says all iterators are invalidated, which seems to intend to be talking about middle-of-container erasures. However, erasing 0 elements isn't really a middle of container erasure.
<p/>
<tt>vector</tt> says that iterators and references are invalidated after the 'point of the erase', but when 0 
elements are erased it's unclear what that even means.
<p/>
We should say that erasures that erase 0 elements are no ops and be clearer about which elements are 
invalidated for <tt>vector</tt>.

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[deque.modifiers]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
iterator erase(const_iterator position);
iterator erase(const_iterator first, const_iterator last);
void pop_front();
void pop_back();
</pre>
<p>
-4- <i>Effects:</i> <ins>Erases elements as indicated in Table 75 [tab:container.seq.req].</ins> 
An erase operation that erases the last element of a deque invalidates only the past-the-end 
iterator and all iterators and references to the erased elements. An erase operation that erases 
the first element of a deque but not the last element invalidates only iterators and references 
to the erased elements. An erase operation that erases <ins>any elements, but</ins> neither the 
first element nor the last element of a deque invalidates the past-the-end iterator and all 
iterators and references to all the elements of the deque. <del>[<i>Note:</i> <tt>pop_front</tt> 
and <tt>pop_back</tt> are erase operations. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
