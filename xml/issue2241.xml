<p>
According to <sref ref="[support.runtime]"/> p2:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The contents of these headers are the same as the Standard C library headers [..], <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>, [..]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Since our base C standard is C99, which doesn't have a <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>, the reference to a non-existing 
C header is irritating (In this context <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> doesn't refer to the deprecated C++ header
<tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> described in <sref ref="[depr.c.headers]"/>).
<p/>
Furthermore, it would be also important that it doesn not define a macro named <tt>alignof</tt>, which C11 also defines 
in this header. 
<p/>
Currently we only have the following guarantee as part of <sref ref="[support.runtime]"/> p7:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The header <tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt> and the header <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> shall not define a macro named 
<tt>alignas</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
It is unclear what the better strategy is: Striking the reference to <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> in
<sref ref="[support.runtime]"/> p2 or upgrading to C11 as new base C standard.

STL: related to earlier issue on C4, <iref ref="2201"/>, and now we get a C11 header<br/>
JY: find _Alignof as keyword C11 FDIS has four defines in stdalign.h<br/>
AM: need paper for C11 as base library we should really do that<br/>
STL: really need vendor input<br/>
STL: don't think we need to do anything right now not P1<br/>
AM: any objections to downscale to P2  (no objections)

Walter: this is on track to go away if we adopt Clark's paper to rebase to C11<br/>
Room: tentatively resolved; revisit after C11 paper: <a href="https://wg21.link/P0063">P0063</a><br/>
