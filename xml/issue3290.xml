<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
The <i>positive-integer</i> in <i>width</i> is a decimal integer defining the minimum field width. If <i>width</i> 
is not specified, there is no minimum field width, and the field width is determined based on the content of the field.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Is field width measured in code units, code points, or something else?
<p/>
Consider the following example assuming a UTF-8 locale:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::format("{}", "\xC3\x81");     // U+00C1        { LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE }
std::format("{}", "\x41\xCC\x81"); // U+0041 U+0301 { LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A } { COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In both cases, the arguments encode the same user-perceived character (&#xc1;). The first uses two UTF-8 
code units to encode a single code point that represents a single glyph using a composed Unicode 
normalization form. The second uses three code units to encode two code points that represent the same 
glyph using a decomposed Unicode normalization form.
<p/>
How is the field width determined? If measured in code units, the first has a width of 2 and the second of 
3. If measured in code points, the first has a width of 1 and the second of 2. If measured in grapheme 
clusters, both have a width of 1. Is the determination locale dependent?
