<p>
This issue was split out from issue <iref ref="4015"/>.
</p>
<p>
`optional`, `variant` and `expected` all use similar wording to require
their contained value to be a subobject, rather than dynamically allocated
and referred to by a pointer, e.g.
<blockquote>
When an instance of `optional<T>` contains a value,
it means that an object of type `T`, referred to as the
optional object’s <i>contained value</i>,
is allocated within the storage of the optional object.
Implementations are not permitted to use additional storage,
such as dynamic memory, to allocate its contained value.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
During the LWG reviews of <paper num="P2300"/> in St. Louis, concerns were
raised about the form of this wording and whether it's normatively meaningful.
Except for the special case of standard-layout class types, the standard has
very few requirements on where or how storage for subobjects is allocated.
The library should not be trying to dictate more than the language guarantees.
It would be better to refer to wording from <sref ref="[intro.object]"/>
such as <i>subobject</i>, <i>provides storage</i>, or <i>nested within</i>.
Any of these terms would provide the desired properties, without using
different (and possibly inconsistent) terminology.
</p>
<p>
Using an array of bytes to <i>provide storage</i> for the contained value would
make it tricky to meet the constexpr requirements of types like `optional`.
This means in practice, the most restrictive of these terms, <i>subobject</i>,
is probably accurate and the only plausible implementation strategy.
However, I don't see any reason to outlaw other implementation strategies that
might be possible in future (say, with a constexpr type cast, or non-standard
compiler-specific instrinics).
For this reason, the proposed resolution below uses <i>nested within</i>,
which provides the desired guarantee without imposing additional restrictions
on implementations.

This wording is relative to <paper num="N4988"/>.

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[optional.optional.general]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote class="note">
[<i>Drafting note</i>:
This edit modifies the same paragraph as issue <iref ref="4015"/>,
but that other issue intentionally doesn't touch the affected sentence here
(except for removing the italics on "contained value").
The intention is that the merge conflict can be resolved in the obvious way:
"An optional object's contained value
is nested within (<sref ref="[intro.object]"/>) the optional object."]
