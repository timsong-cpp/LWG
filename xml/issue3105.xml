<title><tt>T1</tt> is convertible to <tt>T2</tt></title>

<p>
The library wording frequently uses the construction "type <tt>T1</tt> is convertible to type <tt>T2</tt>", 
but this is an undefined phrase.
<p/>
For requirements on user code (e.g. [tuple.rel]), it is unclear whether all expressions of type <tt>T1</tt> 
must satisfy the convertibility requirement, regardless of value category, or whether a single
value category is in view only.
<p/>
Consider:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct C 
{
 operator int() &amp;&amp;;
};

int main()
{
  int x = C();  <i>// prvalue can be implicitly converted to int</i>
  C c;
  int y = c;    <i>// lvalue can't</i>
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The library has an "<tt>is_convertible&lt;T1, T2&gt;</tt>" trait, but that checks convertibility 
only for a single value category, not all possible ones.
