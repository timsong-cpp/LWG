<p>
<sref ref="[fs.dir.itr.members]"/> p2 and <sref ref="[fs.rec.dir.itr.members]"/> p3 refer to the <tt>options</tt> 
parameter, but not all overloads have a parameter of that name.
<p/>
We need some "for the overloads with &hellip;" wording.

<note>2022-12-18; Daniel comments and provides wording</note>
<p>
It seems to me that we should differentiate the problems of <tt>directory_iterator</tt> and 
<tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt> regarding the constructors that don't provide any <tt>options</tt> arguments
at least from a logical point of view:
<p/>
From the existing <i>Postconditions:</i> element of <tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt> we can at least
guess that the intention of the existing wording is that these suppose to reflect that the effective options within 
the <i>Effects:</i> element are also equal to <tt>directory_options::none</tt>. 
But for <tt>directory_iterator</tt> we don't have any options "getter" nor <i>Postconditions</i> from deducing 
the intent. 
<p/>
Fortunately, existing implementations (I looked at the current V2 2022 library and libstdc++ implementation) 
seem to behave already as if <tt>directory_options::none</tt> is set for the affected constructors for both 
iterator types.
<p/>
Note that this issue here has some wording overlap with the the proposed wording of LWG <iref ref="2708"/>,
I'm therefore using the exact wording form currently suggested there. If LWG would like to change this form (e.g.
by using the word "overload" instead of "signature") this should also be done in that other issue to reduce possible
merge conflicts. Note that the here suggested form using "signature" <em>has</em> existing practice in other places
of Clause <sref ref="[filesystems]"/>, so I recommend keeping that form.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4917"/>.

(2) We don't need similar wording for the default constructor because this creates
an end iterator and there exist no way for the user to observe the effects of

[<i>Drafting note:</i><br/>
(1) The proposed wording form takes care to be in sync with the wording form
used in LWG <iref ref="2708"/> at the time of writing. This issue here doesn't
touch the wording for the <tt>options</tt> function though, and leaves any changes 
to LWG <iref ref="2708"/>, because these changes don't seem essential to solve
the issue here.<br/>
(2) We don't need similar wording for the default constructor because this creates
an end iterator and from <sref ref="[fs.class.rec.dir.itr.general]"/> p2 we can
conclude that user code has no way to determine the effective <tt>directory_options</tt> value
of this iterator value (interestingly p15 quoted below can be read to apply here as well,
but <sref ref="[fs.class.rec.dir.itr.general]"/> p2 seems to be very prohibitive and
LWG <iref ref="2708"/> is going to solve this special case as well).<br/>
(3) We easily simplify the wording of p3 as shown below, because the "scope" of the
introductory new paragraph includes the <i>Postconditions:</i> element. But similar to
the arguments provided in (1) we don't wish to introduce merge conflicts with the 
LWG <iref ref="2708"/> wording and therefore intentionally leave any changes of p3 to
that issue.
