<p>
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0767r1">P0767R1 "Expunge POD"</a> changed the
requirement for several library types from "POD" to "trivial." Since these types
no longer provide/require the standard-layout portion of "POD," the change breaks:
<ul>
<li>user classes with a member of such a type that were standard-layout in C++17</li>
<li>implementations of <tt>basic_string</tt> and <tt>basic_string_view</tt> that
expect character types to be both trivial and standard layout.</li>
</ul>
It appears this breakage was not intentional and not discussed in LWG.
</p>
<p>
The fix is straight-forward: apply an additional standard-layout requirement to
the affected types:
<ul>
<li><tt>max_align_t</tt></li>
<li>the <tt>type</tt> member of specializations of <tt>aligned_storage</tt></li>
<li>the <tt>type</tt> member of specializations of <tt>aligned_union</tt></li>
<li>the char-like objects used by <tt>basic_string</tt> and <tt>basic_string_view</tt>.</li>
</ul>
(Albeit the potential for breakage with <tt>max_align_t</tt> is admittedly small.)

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4700">N4700</a> +
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0767r1">P0767R1</a>.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Change in <sref ref="[support.types.layout]"/> paragraph 5:</p>
<p>
The type <tt>max_align_t</tt> is a trivial <ins>standard-layout</ins> type whose
alignment requirement is at least as great as that of every scalar type, and whose
alignment requirement is supported in every context (<sref ref="[basic.align]"/>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the table in <sref ref="[meta.trans.other]"/> as indicated:</p>
<p>
<tt>aligned_storage</tt><br/>
The member typedef <tt>type</tt> shall be a trivial <ins>standard-layout</ins>
type suitable for use as uninitialized storage for any object whose size is at
most <tt>Len</tt> and whose alignment is a divisor of <tt>Align</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>aligned_union</tt><br/>
The member typedef <tt>type</tt> shall be a trivial <ins>standard-layout</ins>
type suitable for use as uninitialized storage for any object whose type is listed
in <tt>Types</tt>; its size shall be at least <tt>Len</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[strings.general]"/> paragraph 1 as indicated:</p>
<p>
This Clause describes components for manipulating sequences of any non-array
trivial <ins>standard-layout</ins> (<sref ref="[basic.types]"/>) type. Such types
are called char-like types, and objects of char-like types are called char-like
objects or simply characters.
