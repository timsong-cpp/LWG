Different implementations give different answers for the following code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;complex&gt;

int main ()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::polar(-1.0, -1.0) &lt;&lt; '\n';
  return 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
One implementation prints:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
(nan, nan)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Another:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
(-0.243068, 0.243068)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Which is correct? Or neither?

I've read this over several times.  I've consulted C++11, C11, and IEC 10967-3.  [snip]
<p/>
I'm finding:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The magnitude of a complex number <tt>== abs(c) == hypot(c.real(), c.imag())</tt> and is always non-negative 
(by all three of the above standards).</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore no complex number exists for which <tt>abs(c) &lt; 0</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore when the first argument to <tt>std::polar</tt> (which is called <tt>rho</tt>) is negative, no complex number 
can be formed which meets the post-conidtion that <tt>abs(c) == rho</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
One could argue that this is already covered in <sref ref="[complex.numbers]"/>/3, but I think it's worth making explicit.

Discussion on whether theta should also be constrained.<br/> 
TK: infinite theta doesn't make sense, whereas infinite rho does (theta is on a compact domain, rho is on a non-compact domain).<br/>
AM: We already have a narrow contract, so I don't mind adding further requirements. Any objections to requiring that theta be finite?<br/>
Some more discussion, but general consensus. Agreement that if someone finds the restrictions problematic, they should write 
a proper paper to address how <tt>std::polar</tt> should behave. For now, we allow infinite rho (but not NaN and not negative), 
and require finite theta. 
<p/>
No objections to tentatively ready.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N4296.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[complex.value.ops]"/> around p9 as indicated</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T&gt; complex&lt;T&gt; polar(const T&amp; rho, const T&amp; theta = 0);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-?- <i>Requires</i>: <tt>rho</tt> shall be non-negative and non-NaN. <tt>theta</tt> shall be finite.</ins>
<p/>
-9- <i>Returns</i>: The complex value corresponding to a complex number whose magnitude is <tt>rho</tt> and whose
phase angle is <tt>theta</tt>.
