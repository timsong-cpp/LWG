<p>
LWG <iref ref="3498"/> fixes the inconsistent <tt>noexcept</tt>-specifiers for member functions of <tt>basic_syncbuf</tt>, 
but the proposed resolution in LWG <iref ref="3498"/> seems to miss the non-member <tt>swap</tt>, which also has 
inconsistent <tt>noexcept</tt>-specifier: <sref ref="[syncstream.syncbuf.special]"/> says it's <tt>noexcept</tt>, 
while <sref ref="syncstream.syn"/> says it's not.
<p/>
Since the non-member <tt>swap</tt> and the member <tt>swap</tt> have equivalent effect, and LWG 3498 removes 
<tt>noexcept</tt> from the latter, I think it's pretty clear that the former should not be <tt>noexcept</tt>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class charT, class traits, class Allocator&gt;
  void swap(basic_syncbuf&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;&amp; a,
            basic_syncbuf&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;&amp; b) <del>noexcept</del>;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to <tt>a.swap(b)</tt>.
