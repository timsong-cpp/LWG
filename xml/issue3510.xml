<title>Customization point objects should be invocable as non-<tt>const</tt> too</title>

<p>
<sref ref="[customization.point.object]"/> promises that customization point objects
are semiregular and that all copies are equal, which permits copies to
be freely made. In C++, making copies tends to drop <i>cv</i>-qualification,
but there does not appear to be anything that guarantees that you can
invoke these objects as non-<tt>const</tt> (or as rvalues, for that matter).
<p/>
It is possible that the use of <tt>invocable&lt;const F&amp;, Args...&gt;</tt> here was
meant to bring in implicit expression variations, but <a href="https://wg21.link/p2102r0">P2102R0</a> 
has since clarified that this formulation doesn't do that.
