<p>
After acceptance of <a href="https://wg21.link/P0941R2">P0941R2</a> into the working draft, in [support.limits.general], 
<tt>__cpp_lib_to_chars</tt> is required to be in <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>. Since the relevant feature 
(<tt>std::to_chars</tt> and <tt>std::from_chars</tt>) is now in the header <tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt>, 
should the macro be defined in <tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>?
</p>
<note>Marshall provides P/R and context</note>
<p><tt>std::to_chars</tt>, etc were originally proposed for the header <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>
and SD-6 reflected that. Somewhere along the way, they was put into their own header 
<tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt>, but the document was never updated to reflect that.</p>
<p>When these macros were added to the standard, the (now incorrect) value was copied as well.</p>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to (the Rapperswil post-mailing standard).</p>

<table border="1">
