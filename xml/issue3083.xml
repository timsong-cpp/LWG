<p>
Is calling <tt>iword</tt> and <tt>pword</tt> with a negative argument undefined, or should it cause 
a failure condition (and return a valid reference)? What about <tt>INT_MAX</tt>? What about <tt>0</tt>?
<p/>
Using arbitrary indices isn't safe, because the implementation could be already using them for 
something else. Some replies on the reflector suggested the only reliable argument is one obtained from 
<tt>ios_base::xalloc()</tt>. Others pointed out that the iwords and pwords could be stored in sparse 
arrays, so that any value from <tt>INT_MIN</tt> to <tt>INT_MAX</tt> could be a valid key (which might 
require the implementation to use keys outside that range for its own entries in the arrays).
<p/>
If it's undefined we should add a <i>Requires</i> element to the spec. If invalid indices are supposed 
to cause a failure we need to define which indices are invalid (and ensure that's something the 
implementation can check), and specify that it causes a failure.
