<title>Names reserved by C for standard library not reserved by C++</title>

<p>
The C standard has a section called "Future library directions". This is subclause 7.31 in C17, which is the 
version that the C++ working draft references. C reserves the names described in that subclause for its standard 
library, allowing C library vendors to introduce some names from future standards as conforming, "orthogonal" 
extensions. ISO C++ does not appear to reserve these names in a clear way. In particular, <sref ref="[reserved.names]"/> 
has wording about names and function signatures "from the C standard library declared with external linkage", 
but C's "Future library directions" describes names that "may be added to the declarations in [some] header[s]".
<p/>
Extra clarity regarding whether these names are actually intended to be reserved by C++ would be appreciated.
