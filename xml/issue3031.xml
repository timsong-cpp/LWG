This doesn't compile with any major implementation:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
int i[1] = { };
std::stable_sort(i, i, [](int&amp; x, int&amp; y) { return x &lt; y; });
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The problem is that the <tt>Compare</tt> expects non-const references. We say "It is assumed that 
<tt>comp</tt> will not apply any non-constant function through the dereferenced iterator" But that 
isn't sufficient to forbid the example.
<p/>
My first thought was to modify [alg.sorting] to make the <tt>Compare</tt> requirements use <tt>comp(as_const(x), as_const(x))</tt> but that would get very verbose to add to every expression using <tt>comp</tt>.
