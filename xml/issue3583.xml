<p>
We do not specify whether or not short-circuiting is expected to happen for individual conditions stated in a <i>Constraints:</i> 
element. For example, <sref ref="[tuple.cnstr]"/> p12 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Constraints:</i> <tt>sizeof...(Types)</tt> equals <tt>sizeof...(UTypes)</tt> and <tt>sizeof...(Types) &le; 1</tt> and 
<tt>is_constructible_v&lt;T<sub><i>i</i></sub> , U<sub><i>i</i></sub>&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt> for all <tt><i>i</i></tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It's not even possible to test the <tt>is_constructible</tt> part unless the first part is true, so presumably it is 
expected that the <tt>sizeof...</tt> expressions are tested first, and so the <tt>is_constructible</tt> traits don't 
even need to be instantiated.
<p/>
In some cases it might be user observable whether short circuiting happens, as whether later conditions are tested might 
affect whether errors outside the immediate context are permitted or not.
<p/>
We should clarify what is intended, and refactor any <i>Constraints:</i> elements that are special cases where something 
different is required.
