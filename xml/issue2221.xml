<p>
When I write 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::cout &lt;&lt; nullptr &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I get a compilation error, "ambiguous overload for '<tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt>' in '<tt>std::cout &lt;&lt; nullptr</tt>'". 
As far as I can tell, the compiler is right to issue that error. There are inserters for <tt>const void*</tt>, 
<tt>const char*</tt>, <tt>const signed char*</tt>, and <tt>const unsigned char*</tt>, and none for 
<tt>nullptr_t</tt>, so the expression really is ambiguous.
<p/>
<em>Proposed wording</em>:
<p/>
The obvious library solution is to add a <tt>nullptr_t</tt> overload, which would be defined something like
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class C, class T&gt;
basic_ostream&lt;C, T&gt;&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(basic_ostream&lt;C, T&gt;&amp; os, nullptr_t) 
{ 
  return os &lt;&lt; (void*) nullptr; 
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
We might also consider addressing this at a core level: add a special-case language rule that addresses all 
cases where you write <tt>f(nullptr)</tt> and <tt>f</tt> is overloaded on multiple pointer types. (Perhaps 
a tiebreaker saying that <tt>void*</tt> is preferred in such cases.)
</p>

<note>2016-01-18, comments from Mike and Ville collected by Walter Brown</note>
<p>
<b>Mike Miller</b>: "Changing overload resolution sounds like something that should be
considered by EWG before CWG [&hellip;]"
<p/>
<b>Ville</b>: "Agreed, such a change would be Evolutionary. Personally, I think it would also be wrong, because 
I don't see how <tt>void*</tt> is the right choice to prefer in the case of code that is currently ambiguous. 
Sure, it would solve this particular library issue, but it seemingly has wider repercussions. If LWG really wants 
to, EWG can certainly discuss this issue, but I would recommend solving it on the LWG side (which doesn't mean 
that the standard necessarily needs to change, I wouldn't call it far-fetched to NAD it)."
</p>

<p>Zhihao recommends NAD:</p>
<p>
<tt>nullptr</tt> is printable if being treated as <tt>void*</tt>, but causes
UB if being treated as <tt>char cv*</tt>. Capturing this ambigurity
at compile time and avoid a runtime UB is a good thing.
</p>

<p>Tues PM: General agreement on providing the overload; discussion on what it should say.</p>
<p>Polls:<br/>
Matt's suggestion (in the issue): 2/0/6/2/2/<br/>
Unspecified output: 3/2/5/0/1<br/>
Specified output: 1/1/6/3/0</p>
<p>Move to Open</p>

<note>2016-08 Chicago</note>
<p>
The group consensus is that we only output <tt>nullptr</tt> because
it is of a fundamental type, causing problems in functions doing
forwarding, and we don't want to read it back.
</p>
<p>Fri PM: Move to Tentatively Ready</p>

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to N4606
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Insert the signature into <sref ref="[ostream]"/>, class template <tt>basic_ostream</tt> synopsis, as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="note">
<p>
[<i>Drafting notes:</i> Why member?  Don't want to define a new category of inserters just for this.]
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace std {
  template &lt;class charT, class traits = char_traits&lt;charT&gt; &gt;
  class basic_ostream
    : virtual public basic_ios&lt;charT, traits&gt; {
  public:
    [&hellip;]
    basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(const void* p);
    <ins>basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(nullptr_t);</ins>
    basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(
      basic_streambuf&lt;char_type, traits&gt;* sb);
    [&hellip;]
  };
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Append the following new paragraphs to <sref ref="[ostream.inserters]"/>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp; operator&lt;&lt;
  (basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits&gt;* sb);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;]
<p/>
-10- <i>Returns:</i> <tt>*this</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>
<ins>basic_ostream&lt;charT, traits&gt;&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(nullptr_t);</ins>
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-??- <i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to <tt>return *this &lt;&lt; s;</tt> where
