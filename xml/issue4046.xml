<p>
The issue was originally discovered while implementing <tt>flat_(multi_)set</tt> in MSVC STL 
(<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/4059">microsoft/STL#4059</a>).
<p/>
Currently, the effects of inserting a single element into or erasing elements from a flat container 
adaptor when an exception is thrown, are implicitly specified in <sref ref="[associative.reqmts.except]"/>.
<p/>
However, given erasing elements from a <tt>vector</tt> or a <tt>deque</tt> generally needs to assign elements, 
which is not guaranteed to be non-throwing, it seems unreasonable to require <tt>erase</tt> of flat container 
adaptors not to throw in such a case. Likewise, as inserting a single value into <tt>deque</tt> is not 
guaranteed to be effectless when an exception is thrown, so flat container adaptors are unlike to provide such 
a guarantee.
<p/>
Perhaps we should conditionally relax the requirements when the underlying containers can't provide them.
