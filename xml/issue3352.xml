[tab:container.req] includes the row:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Expression: <tt>i &lt;=&gt; j</tt>
<p/>
Return Type: <tt>strong_ordering</tt> if <tt>X::iterator</tt> meets the random access iterator requirements, 
otherwise <tt>strong_equality</tt>.
<p/>
Complexity: constant
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
"<tt>strong_equality</tt>" is (now) a meaningless term that appears nowhere else in the working draft. Presumably 
we want to make the Return Type unconditionally <tt>strong_ordering</tt>, and require this expression to be 
valid only when <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> are random access iterators. It's not clear to me if the best way to 
do so would be to add a "<i>Constraints</i>" to the "Assertion/note/pre-/post-condition" column of this table row, 
or if we should pull the row out into yet another "conditionally-supported iterator requirements" table.
