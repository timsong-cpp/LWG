<p>
[For the term SCARY see <paper num="N2911"/> and <paper num="N2913"/>.]
<p/>
In <sref ref="[range.factories]"/> and <sref ref="[range.adaptors]"/>, many iterator types are specified 
as exposition-only nested classes or nested class templates.
<p/>
This has some observable differences from specifying them as class templates declared in the namespace scope:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>value types are generally not associated entities of iterators or sentinels during ADL, which prevents 
unintended overloads to be found;</p></li>
<li><p>two different range adaptor/factory types, e.g. <tt>iota_view&lt;I, S1&gt;</tt> and <tt>iota_view&lt;I, S2&gt;</tt>, 
have different iterator types.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The ADL reduction seems preferable. However, is it intended to required to any two different range 
adaptor/factory types to have two different iterator types, even when the same iterator type can work as expected?
<p/>
Sentinel types don't seem able to be SCARY as they are dependent on iterator types.

Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.

"The ADL hiding stuff is a red herring - SCARY-ness doesn't prevent ADL hiding.
Shouldn't require them to be different types (and similarly should not require
const/non-const iterators to be implemented as class templates with a single
bool template parameter)."
