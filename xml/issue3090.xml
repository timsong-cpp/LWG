<sref ref="[time.duration.cons]"/> p4 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class Rep2, class Period2&gt;
  constexpr duration(const duration&lt;Rep2, Period2&gt;&amp; d);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks:</i> This constructor shall not participate in overload resolution unless no overflow is induced in the 
conversion and <tt>treat_as_floating_point_v&lt;rep&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt> or both 
<tt>ratio_divide&lt;Period2, period&gt;::den</tt> is 1 and <tt>treat_as_floating_point_v&lt;Rep2&gt;</tt> is <tt>false</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
with this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms(3);
duration&lt;int, micro&gt; us = ms;  <i>// OK</i>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms2 = us; <i>// error</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It's unclear to me what "no overflow is induced in the conversion" means in the above. What happens here:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
duration&lt;int, milli&gt; ms(INT_MAX);
duration&lt;int, micro&gt; us = ms;  <i>// ???</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
An overflow is clearly induced in the conversion here: internally, we'll multiply <tt>INT_MAX</tt> by 1000. But that 
cannot be determined statically (in general), and so can't affect the result of overload resolution.
<p/>
So what's actually supposed to happen? Are we actually just supposed to check that <tt>Rep2</tt> is no larger than <tt>Rep</tt>? 
(If so, what happens on overflow? Undefined behavior?)
<p/>
It has been pointed out by Howard Hinnant:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
This refers to the compile-time conversion factor to convert <tt>Period2</tt> to <tt>Period</tt>. If that conversion factor 
is not representable as a (reduced) <tt>ratio&lt;N, D&gt;</tt>, then the constructor is SFINAE'd out. This might happen 
(for example) converting years to picoseconds.
</blockquote>
<p>
I would not have guessed that from the wording. Maybe replacing "no overflow is induced in the conversion" with "the result 
of <tt>ratio_divide&lt;Period2, Period&gt;</tt> is representable as a <tt>ratio</tt>" or similar would help?

<note>2020-09-12 Jonathan adds a proposed resolution</note>
<p>
Since the result of the <tt>ratio_divide</tt> has to be a <tt>ratio</tt>,
if it's not representable then the result simply isn't a valid type.
Implementations are not required to make <tt>ratio_divide</tt> SFINAE-friendly
to implement this constraint. They can perform the equivalent calculations
to check if they would overflow, without actually using <tt>ratio_divide</tt>.
