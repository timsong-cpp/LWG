<title>What is "is initialized" supposed to mean?</title>

<p>
In <sref ref="[locale.codecvt.virtuals]"/> paragraphs 6 and 11, we find:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Preconditions:</i> <tt>(to &lt;= to_end)</tt> is well-defined and <tt>true</tt>; <tt>state</tt> 
is initialized, if at the beginning of a sequence, or else is equal to the result of converting 
the preceding characters in the sequence."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This doesn't make sense. What is the value of <tt>state</tt> if we're at the beginning of a sequence? 
Is the fact that we say that it's initialized in that case supposed to imply that it need not be 
initialized otherwise?
<p/>
Perhaps this means "value-initialized" or "default-initialized" instead of merely "initialized"?
