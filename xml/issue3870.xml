This is the resolution for NB comment <b><a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/nbballot/issues/452">GB-121</a></b>
</p>

<p>
The <tt><i>voidify</i></tt> helper breaks const-correctness, for no tangible benefit.
C++20 ballot comment US 215 also suggested removing it,
but failed to achieve consensus. That should be reconsidered.
</p>
<p>
The only claimed benefits are:
<ul>
<li>Allowing the <tt>uninitialized_xxx</tt> algorithms
to create objects in const storage
(including overwriting objects declared as const which is usually UB).
The caller should be responsible for using <tt>const_cast</tt>
if that's really desirable.
Implicitly removing 'const' is unsafe and unnecessary.
</li>
<li>
Supporting creation of const objects with <tt>std::construct_at</tt>.
This seems reasonable, but should be supported by adding a dedicated
function that doesn't conflate the type of the storage to write to
and the object to create, e.g. <tt>construct_at&lt;const T&gt;(ptr)</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

Casey noted:
</p>
<blockquote>
The claimed benefit is allowing the <tt>uninitialized_xxx</tt> algorithms
to create objects of const and/or volatile type, which they cannot otherwise do
since they deduce the type of object to be created from the reference type
of the pertinent iterator. Creating const objects has some (marginal?) benefits
over using const pointers to mutable objects. For example, their non-mutable
members cannot be modified via casting away const without undefined behavior.
A unit test might take advantage of this behavior to force a compiler to
diagnose such undefined behavior in a constant expression.
</blockquote>
<p>
The issue submitter was aware of this, but an open Core issue,
CWG <a href="https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2514.html">2514</a>,
would invalidate that benefit. If accepted, objects with dynamic storage
duration (such as those created by <tt>std::construct_as</tt> and the
<tt>std::uninitialized_xxx</tt> algorithms) would never be const objects,
so casting away the const would not be undefined. So implicitly removing
const in <tt><i>voidify</i></tt> would still allowing modifying "truly const"
objects (resulting in undefined behaviour), without being able to create
"truly const" objects in locations where that actually <i>is</i> safe.
If CWG 2514 is accepted, the <tt><i>voidify</i></tt> behaviour would be all
downside.
</p>
<p>
LWG requested removing the remaining casts from the proposed resolution,
relying on an implicit conversion to <tt>void*</tt> instead.
Move to Immediate for C++23.
