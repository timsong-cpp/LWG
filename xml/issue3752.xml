Adrian Vogelsgesang noticed that libcxx's <tt>string::substr</tt> 
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/0729d00135ccbe1514a49168bbf26986823235c2/libcxx/include/string#L3573">forward 
the allocator to the newly created string</a>.
<p/>
Nikolas Klauser found that 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/5aae6780236208577b4e8a000cbe7aa3cbc24c41/stl/inc/xstring#L4673">MSVC 
STL does the same thing</a>.
<p/>
While Casey Carter and we all agree that this is a bug and we will fix it, we've "always" been nonconforming here 
and it's weird though that there was never an issue filed and two implementations have the exact same change.
<p/>
So we want a clarification from LWG.

"If you want to provide a different allocator, you can use the substring constructor."
</p>
<p>
"This matches the constructor, whose choice of allocator has been already considered in <iref ref="2402"/>. Any changes here need a paper."
