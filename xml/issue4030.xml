<p>
During the application of <paper num="P0543R0"/>, "Saturation arithmetic", it was pointed out that it 
might not be entirely clear what we want something like "<tt>x</tt> + <tt>y</tt>" to mean. The paper does not 
suggest any formatting for those symbols, and a non-normative note explains that the intention is for 
the expression to be considered mathematically.
<p/>
I wonder if this is clear enough. Notes are not normative, and the document "shall be usable without notes". 
I have formatted this as <tt>$\tcode{x} + \tcode{y}$</tt> throughout, i.e. the variables are in code font, 
but the symbol is maths, not code. This is quite subtle. (See also 
<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/6686">GitHub discussion</a>.)
<p/>
I think it would be an improvement if we simply made the note not be a note. It seems to contain entirely reasonable, mandatory content.

<ol>

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[numeric.sat.func]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <del>[<i>Note 1</i>:</del> In the following descriptions, an arithmetic operation is performed as a mathematical 
operation with infinite range and then it is determined whether the mathematical result fits into the result type. 
<del>&mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
