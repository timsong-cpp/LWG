<p>
Sometimes it is necessary to remove all qualifiers from a type before
passing on to a further API.  A good example would be calling the
<tt>tuple</tt> query APIs <tt>tuple_size</tt> or <tt>tuple_element</tt>
with a deduced type inside a function template.  If the deduced type is
cv-qualified or a reference then the call will fail.  The solution is to
chain calls to
<tt>remove_cv&lt;remove_reference&lt;T&gt;::type&gt;::type</tt>, and
note that the order matters.
</p>
<p>
Suggest it would be helpful to add a new type trait,
<tt>remove_all</tt>, that removes all top-level qualifiers from a type
i.e. cv-qualification and any references.  Define the term in such a way
that if additional qualifiers are added to the language, then
<tt>remove_all</tt> is defined as stripping those as well.

<blockquote><p>
<tt>remove_all</tt> seems too generic, a possible alternative matching
the current naming style could be <tt>remove_cv_reference</tt> or
<tt>remove_reference_cv</tt>. It should also be considered whether this
trait should also remove 'extents', or pointer 'decorations'. Especially
if the latter situations are considered as well, it might be easier to
chose the name not in terms of what it <em>removes</em> (which might be
a lot), but in terms of it <em>creates</em>. In this case I could think
of e.g. <tt>extract_value_type</tt>.

<p>Send a paper to reopen: we’ll need to bikeshed names if we decide to
pursue such a design. It’ll need to discuss difference between this
and decay, and make choices about array types, and discuss why references
are removed but not pointers.</p>
