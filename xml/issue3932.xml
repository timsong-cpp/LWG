<p>
Currently, comparison CPOs may call ADL-found <tt>strong_order</tt>, <tt>weak_order</tt>, and <tt>partial_order</tt> 
functions. It might be impossible to meet the expression-equivalent requirement if one passed argument is a prvalue 
and an ADL-found function is selected, because temporary materialization must take place before entering the CPO's 
<tt>operator()</tt>.
<p/>
Perhaps we should say when <tt>E</tt> or <tt>F</tt> is a prvalue expression of an object type, temporary 
materialization takes place first, and then an xvalue referring to the temporary object is used instead of the original 
<tt>E</tt> or <tt>F</tt>.
<p/>
There is currently implementation divergence in these CPOs: when performing internal comparison, libstdc++ and libc++ 
perfect-forward arguments, while MSVC STL always treats arguments as lvalues.
