LWG <iref ref="2676"/> specified <tt>basic_filebuf::open(const std::filesystem::path::value_type* s, ios_base::openmode mode)</tt> 
by simply reusing the specification for the <tt>const char*</tt> overload, but that specification is incorrect for the wide overload: 
it says that <tt>s</tt> is an NTBS &mdash; a null-terminated byte string &mdash; which it isn't. Moreover, it specifies that 
the file is opened as if by calling <tt>fopen(s, modstr)</tt>, but that call is ill-formed if <tt>s</tt> isn't a <tt>const char*</tt>.

<note>2018-01-16; Jonathan and Tim Song provide wording</note>
<p>
We'll have to ask the Microsoft guys if "as by a call to <tt>fopen</tt>" is OK for them. There are 
paths that can be represented as a wide character string that can't reliably be converted to narrow 
characters (because they become dependent on the current codepage, or some other Windows nonsense) 
so they definitely won't use <tt>fopen</tt>. But as long as they call something that behaves like 
it (which should allow <tt>_fwopen</tt>), I think they'll still meet the spirit of the wording.
