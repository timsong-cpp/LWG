<p>
This is similar to LWG <iref ref="3426"/>: This time the definition of 
<tt>operator&lt;=&gt;(const shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp;, nullptr_t)</tt> is ill-formed, whose effects are essentially 
specified as calling:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
compare_three_way()(a.get(), nullptr)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This call will be ill-formed by constraint-violation, because both <tt>nullptr &lt;=&gt; nullptr</tt> as well as 
<tt>((T*) 0) &lt;=&gt; nullptr</tt> are ill-formed.
<p/>
As a short-term solution we can make it work as intended &mdash; equivalent to LWG <iref ref="3426"/> &mdash; by 
comparing <tt>a.get()</tt> to <tt>(element_type*) nullptr</tt> instead of to <tt>nullptr</tt> directly.
<p/>
As a long-term solution we should at least consider to deprecate the mixed relational operators as well as the 
mixed three-way comparison operator of all our smart-pointers with <tt>std::nullptr_t</tt> since the core language 
has eliminated relational comparisons of pointers with <tt>std::nullptr_t</tt> with 
<a href="http://wg21.link/n3624">N3624</a> four years after they had been originally accepted by 
<a href="http://wg21.link/cwg879">CWG 879</a>. Consequently, for C++20, the mixed three-way comparison between 
pointers and <tt>nullptr</tt> is not supported either. For this long-term solution I'm suggesting to handle this
via a proposal.
