<p>
There are various problems with the specification of <tt>list::unique</tt> and its <tt>forward_list</tt> counterpart, some of which are obvious even on cursory inspection:
<ul>
<li>It refers to the identifiers <tt>first</tt> and <tt>last</tt>, which aren't even defined.</li>
<li>It uses <tt>i - 1</tt> on non-random-access iterators - in the case of <tt>forward_list</tt>, on forward-only iterators.</li>
<li>The resolution of LWG <iref ref="202"/>, changing the specification of <tt>std::unique</tt> to require an equivalence relation 
    and adjusting the order of comparison, weren't applied to these member functions.</li>
</ul>
<p/>
LWG <iref ref="491"/>, which pointed out many of those problems with the specification of <tt>list::unique</tt>, was closed as NAD with the rationale that
<blockquote>
"All implementations known to the author of this Defect Report comply with these assumption", and "no impact on current code is expected", i.e. there is no evidence of real-world confusion or harm.
</blockquote>
That implementations somehow managed to do the right thing in spite of obviously defective standardese doesn't seem like a good reason to not fix the defects.

<note>2017-07 Toronto Tuesday PM issue prioritization</note>
<p>Priority 3; by the way, there's general wording in <sref ref="[algorithms.requirements]"/> p10 that lets us specify iterator arithmetic as if we were using random access iterators.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4659">N4659</a>.
