Consider:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;ranges&gt;

struct Abstract {
  virtual ~Abstract() = default;
  virtual int f() = 0;
};

struct Concrete : Abstract {
  int f() override { return 42; }
};

int main() {
  Concrete c[10];

  auto xformed = c | std::views::transform([](Concrete&amp; c) -&gt; Abstract&amp; {
    return c;
  });

  for (Abstract&amp; a : xformed) { }  // <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">ok</span>

  auto zipped = std::views::zip(xformed);

  for (auto&amp;&amp; [a] : zipped) { }    // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">error</span>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Here, <tt>xformed</tt> is a range whose reference type is <tt>Abstract&amp;</tt> and whose <tt>value_type</tt> is <tt>Abstract</tt>. 
Even though you can't actually create a value of that <tt>value_type</tt>, that's okay here, because no code is actually trying to do so.
<p/>
On the other hand, <tt>zipped</tt> is a range whose reference type is <tt>std::tuple&lt;Abstract&amp;&gt;</tt> and whose 
<tt>value_type</tt> is <tt>std::tuple&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt>. No code here is actually trying to construct a <tt>value_type</tt> either, 
but this code fails because simply instantiating <tt>std::tuple&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt> is an error. There's no other possible 
<tt>value_type</tt> for <tt>zipped</tt> to have, <tt>std::tuple&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt> is correct &mdash; it's just that it happens 
to be an ill-formed type in this context. There are workarounds for this case &mdash; you would have to make <tt>xformed</tt> 
be a range of <tt>Abstract*</tt> or, probably better, a range of <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt> instead. 
<p/>
This is unfortunate because many (most?) algorithms don't actually make any use of a range's <tt>value_type</tt>. The ones that do 
(like <tt>ranges::min</tt>) obviously could not work, but currently we end up rejecting all uses. Probably the only possible way to 
make this work is to allow <tt>value_type</tt> to be <tt>void</tt> (or absent), but it is currently a fairly fundamental type due 
to its use in <tt>indirectly_readable</tt> to identify input iterators.

<note>2023-02-06; Reflector poll</note>
<p>
Set priority to 4 after reflector poll.
Several votes for NAD. Maybe <tt>tuple&lt;Abstract&gt;</tt> should be
explicitly made ill-formed (currently seems underspecified) or should be
"disabled" like invalid <tt>hash</tt> specializations and formatters.
