<p><b>Addresses: fund.ts</b></p>

<p>
This issue against the TS is similar to LWG <iref ref="2386"/>, which is against the standard. The Effects clauses for the assignment 
operator for class template <tt>function</tt> are written as code that constructs a temporary <tt>function</tt> and then swaps it 
with <tt>*this</tt>. 
The intention appears to be that assignment should have the strong exception guarantee, i.e., <tt>*this</tt> is not modified if 
an exception is thrown. The description in the standard is incorrect when <tt>*this</tt> was originally constructed using an 
allocator. The TS attempts to correct the problem, but the correction is incomplete.
<p/>
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3908.html#mods.func.wrap">The wording in the TS</a> uses 
<tt>get_memory_resource()</tt> to construct a temporary <tt>function</tt> object with the same allocator as the left-hand size 
(lhs) of the assignment. The intended result of using this pattern was that the allocator for <tt>*this</tt> would be unchanged, 
but it doesn't quite work. The problem is that the allocator returned by <tt>get_memory_resource()</tt> is not the same type as 
the type-erased allocator used to construct the <tt>function</tt> object, but rather a type-erased distillation of that type that 
is insufficient for making a true copy of the allocator. The rules for type-erased allocators in the TS 
(<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3908.html#memory.type.erased.allocator">[memory.type.erased.allocator]</a>) 
specify that the lifetime of the object returned by <tt>get_memory_resource()</tt> is sometimes tied to the lifetime of <tt>*this</tt>, 
which might cause the (single copy of) the allocator to be destroyed if the <tt>swap</tt> operation destroys and reconstructs <tt>*this</tt>, 
as some implementations do (and are allowed to do).
<p/>
The desired behavior is that assignment would leave the allocator of the lhs unchanged. The way to achieve this behavior is to 
construct the temporary <tt>function</tt> using the original allocator. Unfortunately, we cannot describe the desired behavior in 
pure code, because <tt>get_memory_resource()</tt> does not really name the type-erased allocator, as mentioned above. The PR below, 
therefore, uses pseudo-code, inventing a fictitious <tt><i>ALLOCATOR_OF</i>(f)</tt> expression that evaluates to the actual allocator 
type, even if that allocator was type erased. I have implemented this PR successfully.

Apply to Library Fundamentals TS (after removing the previous "Throws: Nothing" element to prevent an editorial conflict with
<iref ref="2401"/>).
