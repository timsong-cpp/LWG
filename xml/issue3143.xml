<p>
During the discussion of LWG <iref ref="3120"/> it was pointed out that the current
wording in <sref ref="[mem.res.monotonic.buffer]"/> is contradictory. The introductory text for 
the class says "Each additional buffer is larger than the previous one, following 
a geometric progression" but the spec for <tt>do_allocate</tt> doesn't agree.
<p/>
Firstly, it's impossible for the implementation to ensure a single geometric progression, 
because the size of the next buffer can be arbitrarily large. If the caller asks for an 
allocation that is <tt>N</tt> times bigger than the previous buffer, the next buffer will be at
least <tt>N</tt> times larger than the previous one. If <tt>N</tt> is larger than the
implementation-defined growth factor it's not a geometric progression.
<p/>
Secondly, it's not even clear that each additional buffer will be larger than the previous one. 
Given a <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource</tt> object with little remaining space in <tt>current_buffer</tt>, 
a request to allocate <tt>10*next_buffer_size</tt> will:
<p/>
"set <tt>current_buffer</tt> to <tt>upstream_rsrc-&gt;allocate(n, m)</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is not
less than <tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt> and <tt>m</tt> is not less than <tt>alignment</tt>, 
and increase <tt>next_buffer_size</tt> by an implementation-defined growth factor (which need not 
be integral), then allocate the return block from the newly-allocated <tt>current_buffer</tt>."
<p/>
The effects are to allocate a new buffer of at least <tt>max(10*next_buffer_size, next_buffer_size)</tt> 
bytes, and then do <tt>next_buffer_size *= growth_factor</tt>. If <tt>growth_factor &lt; 10</tt> then 
the next allocated buffer might be smaller than the last one. This means that although 
<tt>next_buffer_size</tt> itself follows a geometric progression, the actual size of any single 
allocated buffer can be much larger than <tt>next_buffer_size</tt>. A graph of the allocated sizes looks 
like a geometric progression with spikes where an allocation size is larger than <tt>next_buffer_size</tt>.
<p/>
If the intention is to set <tt>next_buffer_size = max(n, next_buffer_size * growth_factor)</tt> so 
that every allocation from upstream is larger than the previous one, then we need a change to the 
<i>Effects:</i> to actually say that. Rather than a geometric progression with anomalous spikes,
this would produce a number of different geometric progressions with discontinuous jumps between them.
<p/>
If the spiky interpretation is right then we need to weaken the "Each additional buffer is larger" 
statement. Either way, we need to add a caveat to the "following a geometric progression" text 
because that isn't true for the spiky interpretation or the jumpy interpretation.
<p/>
Thirdly, the <i>Effects:</i> says that the size of the allocated block, <tt>n</tt>, is not less than 
<tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt>. This seems to allow an implementation to choose to do 
<tt>n = ceil2(max(bytes, next_buffer_size))</tt> if it wishes (maybe because allocating sizes that 
are a power of 2 simplifies the <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource</tt> implementation, or allows reducing 
the bookkeeping overhead). This still results in an approximate geometric progression (under either 
the spiky or jumpy interpretation) but the graph has steps rather than being a smooth curve (but 
always above the curve). This is another way that "Each additional buffer is larger than the previous 
one" is not guaranteed. Even if <tt>max(bytes, next_buffer_size)</tt> is greater on every call, for a
growth factor between <tt>1.0</tt> and <tt>2.0</tt> the result of <tt>ceil2</tt> might be the same 
for two successive buffers. I see no reason to forbid this, but Pablo suggested it's not allowed 
because it doesn't result in exponential growth (which I disagree with). If this is supposed to be
forbidden, the wording needs to be fixed to forbid it.

<p>
LWG looked at the issue and a suggestion was presented to eliminate most of <sref ref="[mem.res.monotonic.buffer]"/>
to solve the problem the current requirements impose.

<p>Reviewed revised wording and moved to Ready for Varna.</p>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4849">N4849</a>.</p>

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[mem.res.monotonic.buffer]"/>, as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- A <tt>monotonic_buffer_resource</tt> is a special-purpose memory resource intended for very fast memory allocations
in situations where memory is used to build up a few objects and then is released all at once when the
memory resource object is destroyed. <del>It has the following qualities:</del>
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none"> 
<li><p><del>(1.1) &mdash; A call to <tt>deallocate</tt> has no effect, thus the amount of memory consumed increases 
monotonically until the resource is destroyed.</del></p></li>
<li><p><del>(1.2) &mdash; The program can supply an initial buffer, which the allocator uses to satisfy memory requests.</del></p></li>
<li><p><del>(1.3) &mdash; When the initial buffer (if any) is exhausted, it obtains additional buffers from an upstream 
memory resource supplied at construction. Each additional buffer is larger than the previous one, following a
geometric progression.</del></p></li>
<li><p><del>(1.4) &mdash; It is intended for access from one thread of control at a time. Specifically, calls to <tt>allocate</tt> and
<tt>deallocate</tt> do not synchronize with one another.</del></p></li>
<li><p><del>(1.5) &mdash; It frees the allocated memory on destruction, even if <tt>deallocate</tt> has not been called 
for some of the allocated blocks.</del></p></li>
