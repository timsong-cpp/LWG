<p><b>Addresses GB 57</b></p>

<p>The contents of <tt>&lt;codecvt&gt;</tt> are underspecified, and will take a reasonable 
amount of work to identify and correct all of the issues. There appears to be a general 
feeling that this is not the best way to address unicode transcoding in the first 
place, and this library component should be retired to Annex D, along side 
<tt>&lt;strstream&gt;</tt>, until a suitable replacement is standardized.</p>

<p>
Proposed change:
</p>
<p>
Deprecate and move the whole of clause <sref ref="[locale.stdcvt]"/> to Annex D.
