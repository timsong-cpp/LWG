<p>
The term "character type" is used in <sref ref="[defns.ntcts]"/>, <sref ref="[locale.category]"/>,
<sref ref="[iostreams.limits.pos]"/>, <sref ref="[ostream.formatted.reqmts]"/>, and
<sref ref="[ostream.inserters.character]"/>, but the core language only defines
"narrow character types" (<sref ref="[basic.fundamental]"/>).
<p/>
"wide-character type" is used in <sref ref="[depr.locale.stdcvt]"/>, but the core
language only defines a "wide-character set" and "wide-character literal".
</p>

<note>2023-06-14; Varna; Daniel comments and provides wording</note>
<p>
Given the resolution of <paper num="P2314"/> which had introduced to
<sref ref="[basic.fundamental]"/> p11 a definition of "character type":
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The types <tt>char</tt>, <tt>wchar_t</tt>, <tt>char8_t</tt>, <tt>char16_t</tt>, <tt>char32_t</tt> are collectively
called <i>character types</i>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
one might feel tempted to have most parts of this issue resolved here, but I think that this
actually is a red herring.
<p/>
First, as Jonathan already pointed out, for two places, <sref ref="[ostream.formatted.reqmts]"/> and
<sref ref="[ostream.inserters.character]"/>, this clearly doesn't work, instead it seems as if we 
should replace "character type of the stream" here by "<tt>char_type</tt> of the stream".
<p/>
To me "<tt>char_type</tt> of the stream" sounds a bit odd (we usually refer to <tt>char_type</tt>
in terms of a qualified name such as <tt>X::char_type</tt> instead unless we are specifying
a member of some <tt>X</tt>, where we can omit the qualification) and in the suggested
wording below I'm taking advantage of the already defined term "character container type"
(<sref ref="[defns.character.container]"/>) instead, which seems to fit its intended purpose here.
<p/>
Second, on further inspection it turns out that actually only <em>one</em> usage of the
term "character type" seems to be intended to refer to the actual core language meaning (See
the unchanged wording for <sref ref="[facet.num.put.virtuals]"/> in the proposed wording
below), all other places quite clearly must refer to the above mentioned
"character container type".
<p/>
For the problem related to the missing definition of "wide-character type" (used two times in
<sref ref="[depr.locale.stdcvt]"/>) I would like to suggest a less general and less inventive
approach to solve the definition problem here, because it only occurs in an already deprecated
component specification: My suggestion is to simply get rid of that term
by just identifying <tt>Elem</tt> with being one of <tt>wchar_t</tt>, <tt>char16_t</tt>, or, 
<tt>char32_t</tt>. (This result is identical to identifying "wide-character type" with
a "character type that is not a narrow character type (<sref ref="[basic.fundamental]"/>)", but this
seemingly more general definition doesn't provide a real advantage.)

<note>2023-06-25; Daniel comments</note>
<p>
During the Varna LWG discussions of this issue it had been pointed out that the wording change applied to
<sref ref="[depr.locale.stdcvt.req]"/> bullet (1.1) could exclude now the previously allowed support
of narrow character types as a "wide-character" with e.g. a <tt>Maxcode</tt> value of 255. First,
I don't think that the revised wording really forbids this. Second, the originating proposal
<paper num="N2401"/> doesn't indicate what the actual intend here was and it seems questionable to
assign LEWG to this issue given that the relevant wording is part of deprecated components, especially
given their current position expressed <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/1527#issuecomment-1565907454">here</a>
to eliminate the specification of the affected components as suggested by <paper num="P2871"/>.

[<i>Drafting note:</i> The more general interpretation of "character container type" instead of character type by

the core language character types, but still could impose additional constraints imposed on them. Even if an implementation
does never intend to support anything beyond <tt>char</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt>, the wording below is harmless.
One alternative could be here to use the even more general term "char-like types" from <sref ref="[strings.general]"/>,
