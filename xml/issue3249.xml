<p>
According to SG1 experts, the requirement in [atomics.lockfree]/2 is intended to require that 
the answer for <tt>is_lock_free()</tt> be the same for a given <tt>T</tt> for a given run of 
the program. The wording does not achieve that because it's described in terms of 'pointers', 
but there are no pointers in an <tt>atomic&lt;int&gt;</tt>.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4830">N4830</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[atomics.lockfree]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-2- The function<ins>s <tt>atomic&lt;T&gt;::is_lock_free</tt>, and</ins> <tt>atomic_is_lock_free</tt> 
(<sref ref="[atomics.types.operations]"/>) indicate<del>s</del> whether the object is lock-free. In any given program execution, the result of the lock-free query <ins>is the same for all atomic objects</ins> <del>shall 
be consistent for all pointers</del> of the same type.
