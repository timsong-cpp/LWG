Consider
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
decltype(std::declval&lt;std::chrono::leap_second&amp;>() &lt;=&gt; std::chrono::system_clock::now())
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
There is a <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> operator for leap second defined as
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Duration&gt;
  requires three_way_comparable_with&lt;sys_seconds, sys_time&lt;Duration&gt;&gt;
  constexpr auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const leap_second&amp; x, const sys_time&lt;Duration&gt;&amp; y) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In order to resolve this overload, we need to check the constraints.
<tt>three_way_comparable_with</tt> will end up checking that <tt>sys_seconds{} &lt; sys_time&lt;Duration&gt;{}</tt> 
is a valid expression. 
To do that, we run overload resolution, find a bunch of <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt>, including the <tt>leap_second</tt> 
overload mentioned above.
We check its constraints... and we find ourselves doing that recursively.
<p/>
This problem currently doesn't manifest in production compilers because of a number of 
<a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/core/2023/03/14041.php">non-conforming behaviors of 
all implementations</a>, but surfaced while fixing some of these issues in clang.
<p/>
libstdc++ also does not suffer from this issue because <tt>leap_seconds</tt> comparisons operators are all hidden 
friends (in fact, libstdc++ define hidden friends comparison operators for most of the objects in chrono, which is 
nice!)
<p/>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Specify that <tt>leap_seconds</tt> operators are hidden friends. This would avoid the recursion, and would be easier 
on compilers.
</p>

<note>2024-08-21; Reflector poll</note>
<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
Support for changing all relational ops for calendar types to hidden friends,
but only doing it for `leap_second` would be in scope for this issue.
