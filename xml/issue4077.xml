<p>
Per discussion in <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/6904">cplusplus/draft#6904</a>, 
the preconditions of `std::ranges::generate_random` are specified in an unusual way. 
It also appears that the "shall be equivalent" imposes requirements on both implementation and user code, 
and the requirements are not very clear. 
Perhaps we should clarify the conditions in usual <i>Preconditions</i> paragraphs.
