<title>Missing <tt>hash</tt> specializations for extended integer types</title>

<p>
According to the header <tt>&lt;functional&gt;</tt> synopsis <sref ref="[function.objects]"/> 
and to the explicit description in <sref ref="[unord.hash]"/> class template 
<tt>hash</tt> specializations shall be provided for all arithmetic types that are 
not extended integer types. This is not explicitly mentioned, but neither the list 
nor any normative wording does include them, so it follows by implication.
<p/>
What are the reasons that extended integer types are excluded? E.g. for 
<tt>numeric_limits</tt> corresponding specializations are required. I would 
expect that an <tt>unordered_map</tt> with key type <tt>std::uintmax_t</tt> would 
just work, but that depends now on whether this type is an extended integer type 
or not.
<p/>
This issue is <em>not</em> asking for also providing specializations for the
<i>cv</i>-qualified arithmetic types. While this is surely a nice-to-have feature,
I consider that restriction as a more secondary problem in practice.
<p/>
The proposed resolution also fixes a problem mentioned in <iref ref="2109"/> in regard
to confusing requirements on user-defined types and those on implementations.

Move to Open.

<p>
Agreed that it's a real issue and that the proposed wording fixes it. However, the wording
change is not minimal and isn't consistent with the way we fixed hash wording elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Alisdair will provide updated wording.
