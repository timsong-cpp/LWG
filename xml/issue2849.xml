<sref ref="[fs.op.copy_file]"/>/4 says that <tt>copy_file</tt> reports "a file already exists error as specified in 
[fs.err.report] if" any of several error conditions exist.
<p/>
It's not clear how some of those error conditions, such as <tt>!is_regular_file(from)</tt>, can be sensibly described 
as "file already exists". Pretty much everywhere else in the filesystem specification just says "an error" without 
further elaboration.

<p>Priority 2; Jonathan to provide updated wording.</p>

<p>
I said I'd provide updated wording because I wanted to preserve the requirement that the reported error is 
"file already exists" for some of the error cases. I no longer think that's necessary, so I think the 
current P/R is fine. Please note that I don't think new wording is needed.
