<p><a href="http://wg21.link/p0091r3">P0091R3</a> "Template argument deduction for class templates (Rev. 6)" was adopted 
for the core language, but the Standard Library makes no explicit use of this new feature, even though the promise of 
such use provided strong motivation for the feature.</p>

<p>Proposed change: Analyze the Standard Library's constructors to determine which classes would profit from explicit 
deduction guides. Formulate the appropriate guides for those classes and insert them in their respective types.</p>

<p><a href="http://wg21.link/p0433">P0433</a> is an attempt to do exactly this.</p>
