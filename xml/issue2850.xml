Consider [func.wrap.func.con]/p5:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
function(function&amp;&amp; f);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> If <tt>!f</tt>, <tt>*this</tt> has no target; otherwise, move constructs the target of <tt>f</tt> into the target 
of <tt>*this</tt>, leaving <tt>f</tt> in a valid state with an unspecified value.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
By my reading, this wording requires the move constructor of <tt>std::function</tt> to construct an entirely new target object. 
This is silly: in cases where the target is held in separately allocated memory (i.e. where the target doesn't fit in 
<tt>std::function</tt>'s internal buffer, if any), <tt>std::function</tt>'s move constructor can be implemented by simply 
transferring ownership of the existing target object (which is a simple pointer assignment), so this requirement forces an 
unnecessary constructor invocation and probably an unnecessary allocation (the latter can be avoided with something like 
double-buffering, but ew). Fixing this would technically be a visible change, but I have a hard time imagining reasonable 
code that would be broken by it, especially since both libstdc++ and libc++ already do the sensible thing, constructing a 
new target only if the target is held in an internal buffer, and otherwise assigning pointers.

<p>This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4618">N4618</a>.</p>
