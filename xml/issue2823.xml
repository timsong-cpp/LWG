LWG <iref ref="2590"/>'s resolution is incomplete:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::array&lt;int, 1&gt; arr{{0}};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
should be fine, but isn't guaranteed, since <tt>{0}</tt> has no type. We should rather go for implicit conversion:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An array is an aggregate (<sref ref="[dcl.init.aggr]"/>) that can be list-initialized with up to <tt>N</tt> elements 
<del>whose types are convertible to <tt>T</tt></del><ins>that can be implicitly converted to <tt>T</tt></ins>.
</p></blockquote>

<note>2016-11-26, Tim Song comments</note>
<p> 
This is not possible as written, because due to the brace elision rules for aggregate initialization,
<tt>std::array&lt;int, 2&gt; arr{{0}, {1}};</tt> will never work: the <tt>{0}</tt> 
is taken as initializing the inner array, and the <tt>{1}</tt> causes an error.
</p>

<p>Priority 2; consensus is that the P/R is not quite right.</p>

<p>Jens: There's nothing you can do about the double braces in std::array. That's a core thing.</p>
<p>STL to write paper to resolve this.</p>
