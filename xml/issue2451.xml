<p>
Code such as the following is currently ill-formed (thanks to STL for the compelling example):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
optional&lt;string&gt; opt_str = "meow";
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is because it would require two user-defined conversions (from <tt>const char*</tt> to <tt>string</tt>, 
and from <tt>string</tt> to <tt>optional&lt;string&gt;</tt>) where the language permits only one. This is 
likely to be a surprise and an inconvenience for users.
<p/>
<tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt> should be implicitly convertible from any <tt>U</tt> that is implicitly convertible 
to <tt>T</tt>. This can be implemented as a non-explicit constructor template <tt>optional(U&amp;&amp;)</tt>, 
which is enabled via SFINAE only if <tt>is_convertible_v&lt;U, T&gt;</tt> and <tt>is_constructible_v&lt;T, U&gt;</tt>, 
plus any additional conditions needed to avoid ambiguity with other constructors (see 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4064.html">N4064</a>, particularly the 
"Odd" example, for why <tt>is_convertible</tt> and <tt>is_constructible</tt> are both needed; thanks to Howard 
Hinnant for spotting this). 
<p/>
In addition, we may want to support explicit construction from <tt>U</tt>, which would mean providing a corresponding 
explicit constructor with a complementary SFINAE condition (this is the single-argument case of the "perfect 
initialization" pattern described in N4064).
