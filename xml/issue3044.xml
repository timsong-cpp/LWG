<title>Strange specification of <tt>max_size()</tt> for an allocator</title>

<p>
Table 31 in the C++17 standard specifies <tt>X::max_size()</tt> (where <tt>X</tt> is an allocator type) as "The largest value 
that can meaningfully be passed to <tt>X::allocate()</tt>". Noticeably missing is the statement "<i>Throws:</i> Nothing".
<p/>
As an example of why this is an issue, note that <tt>vector::max_size()</tt> and <tt>allocator_traits::max_size()</tt> are 
both marked <tt>noexcept</tt>. We must then interpret <tt>max_size()</tt> as being allowed to sometimes call 
<tt>std::terminate</tt>, or else <tt>{vector, allocator_traits, ...}::max_size()</tt> must be allowed to directly calculate 
<tt>numeric_limits&lt;size_type&gt;::max() / sizeof(value_type)</tt> instead of querying the allocator, even if 
<tt>Alloc::max_size()</tt> exists. This seems like a bug in the wording for the requirements of <tt>max_size()</tt> in an 
allocator type. I think an issue should be opened on this subject to add <i>Throws:</i> Nothing or similar to the requirements 
of <tt>max_size()</tt> for an allocator.
<p/>
As an example consider writing up a framework to test the exception-safety of types in a given framework, since they were all 
written in an exception-free environment. One of the types in the framework is an allocator which, in a controlled way, 
can throw an exception at any point where it is allowed by the standard. It's important that the test framework be as pedantic 
as possible, so the allocator type throws on <tt>max_size()</tt>, since it is currently allowed to by the standard. When a 
reasonable <tt>vector</tt> implementation (at least those in libstdc++ and msvc) is, for example, asked to construct a 
<tt>vector</tt> from an <tt>initializer_list</tt>, it will call <tt>allocator_traits&lt;Alloc&gt;::max_size()</tt>, which will 
terminate the program because the exception thrown in <tt>Alloc::max_size()</tt> propagated through the <tt>noexcept</tt> 
traits function. Although this is conformant behavior, I think it's a bug in the standard that a function as benign as 
<tt>max_size()</tt> can terminate the program in this manner, and I think the fix is that a conformant allocator should be 
required to supply a non-throwing <tt>max_size()</tt> member function.
<p/>
Daniel:
<p/>
This problem was shortly discussed during review of LWG <iref ref="2162"/> (see comment 2012-08-05). At that time
the more drastic but also more consistent requirement that an allocator's <tt>max_size</tt> function shall not throw
exceptions has not been added. IMO this position should be reconsidered to follow the spirit of the new issue LWG 
<iref ref="3044"/>.

<note>2018-08-21, Jonathan comments and provides wording</note>
<p>
The phrase "the largest value that can meaningfully be passed to <tt>X::allocate()</tt>" is meaningless. Is it a 
requirement on the caller, so that larger values must not be passed? Or a hint from the allocator implementor that larger 
values will produce a <tt>bad_alloc</tt> exception? Can the return value change dynamically, based on the free memory
available to the allocator?! &mdash; LWG <iref ref="197"/> says it can't change.
<p/>
As noted in the LWG <iref ref="2162"/> comments, we don't currently guarantee it can be called on a <tt>const</tt> object 
(so <tt>allocator_traits</tt> will not use the allocator's <tt>max_size()</tt> if it's non-<tt>const</tt>, although that was 
unclear before DR <iref ref="2284"/>). In addition to adding "<i>Throws:</i> nothing" we should ensure it's callable 
on <tt>const</tt> lvalues, and clarify what "meaningfully" means and who is supposed to care about it. My proposed 
resolution doesn't achieve all of this, but is a start.
