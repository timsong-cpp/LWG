<p>
Some standard library types, such as <tt>std::pair</tt>, <tt>std::tuple</tt>, and <tt>std::array</tt>, 
are currently allowed to have a member or element type with a destructor that is <tt>noexcept(false)</tt>. 
In order to conform to <sref ref="[res.on.exception.handling]"/>/3, these types can't always have 
implicitly declared destructors because the implicit exception specification may be <tt>noexcept(false)</tt>.
<p/>
However, it may be intentional to implement these types with implicitly declared destructors, and 
mainstream implementations (libc++, libstdc++, and MSVC STL) are already doing so.
<p/>
Furtherly, explicitly declared destructors are not allowed for algorithm result types 
(<sref ref="[algorithms.results]"/>), while currently these class templates are allowed to be instantiated 
with classes with potentially throwing destructors, which is contradictory to <sref ref="[res.on.exception.handling]"/>/3.
