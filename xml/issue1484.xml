<p>
There is no way to join a thread with a timeout.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<blockquote><p>
Add <tt>join_for</tt> and <tt>join_until</tt>. Or decide one should
never join a thread with a timeout since <tt>pthread_join</tt> doesn't have a 
timeout version.

The concurrency working group deemed this an extension beyond the scope of C++0x.

SG1 recommends: Close as NAD
<p/>
There has not been much demand for it, and it would usually be difficult to deal with <tt>thread_local</tt> destructor races. 
It can be approximated with a condition variable wait followed by an unconditional <tt>join</tt>. Adding it would create 
implementation issues on Posix. As always, this may be revisited if we have a paper exploring the issues in detail.
