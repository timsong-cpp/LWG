<sref ref="[syserr.errcat.overview]"/> says:
<blockquote>
The class `error_category` serves as a base class for types used to identify
the source and encoding of a particular category of error code.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
However, it actually fails to identify any encodings and, remarkably,
this is the only place in the whole diagnostics section that mentions the
word "encoding". The definition of `error_category::message`
(<sref ref="[syserr.errcat.virtuals]"/> p5) just says:
<blockquote>
<pre><code>virtual string message(int ev) const = 0;</code></pre>
<p>
<i>Returns</i>:
A string that describes the error condition denoted by `ev`.
</p>
</blockquote>
This makes it pretty much impossible to reliably use the provided API
for its intended purpose.
</p>
<p>
There is also implementation divergence:
some implementations use variants of `strerror` which return messages
in the current C locale encoding,
but at least one major implementation doesn't use the current C locale:
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/4711">MSVC STL issue 4711</a>.
</p>
<p>
Using the current C locale is obviously problematic.
First, it is inconsistent with other C++ APIs that normally use C++ locales.
Second, because it is a global state, it may change
(possibly from another thread)
between the time the message is obtained and the time it needs to be consumed,
which may lead to mojibake.
At the very least there should be a mechanism that captures the encoding
information in a race-free manner and communicates it to the caller
if the locale encoding is used
although it is better not to use it in the first place.
</p>
<p>
This is somewhat related to LWG <iref ref="4087"/>
but should probably be addressed first because it may affect
how some exceptions are defined.
</p>
<p>
The proposed resolution is similar to the one of LWG <iref ref="4087"/>.

This wording is relative to <paper num="N4988"/>.

<pre><code>virtual string message(int ev) const = 0;</code></pre>

<i>Returns</i>:
A string <ins>in the ordinary literal encoding</ins>
that describes the error condition denoted by `ev`.
