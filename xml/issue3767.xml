<p>
Table [tab:locale.category.facets] includes the following two facets:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>codecvt&lt;char16_t, char8_t, mbstate_t&gt;</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>codecvt&lt;char32_t, char8_t, mbstate_t&gt;</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
However, neither of those actually has anything to do with a locale and therefore 
it doesn't make sense to dynamically register them with <tt>std::locale</tt>. 
Instead they provide conversions between fixed encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) 
that are unrelated to locale encodings other than they may happen to coincide with 
encodings of some locales by accident.
<p/>
The issue was introduced when adding <tt>codecvt&lt;char[16|32]_t, char, mbstate_t&gt;</tt> in 
<paper num="N2035"/> which gave no design rationale for using <tt>codecvt</tt> in the first 
place. Likely it was trying to do a minimal amount of changes and copied the wording for 
<tt>codecvt&lt;wchar_t, char, mbstate_t&gt;</tt> but unfortunately didn't consider encoding implications.
<p/>
<paper num="P0482"/> changed <tt>char</tt> to <tt>char8_t</tt> in these facets which 
made the issue more glaring but unfortunately, despite the breaking change, it failed to address it.
<p/>
Apart from an obvious design mistake this also adds a small overhead for every locale 
construction because the implementation has to copy these pseudo-facets for no good 
reason violating "don't pay for what you don't use" principle.
<p/>
A simple fix is to remove the two facets from table [tab:locale.category.facets] and make them 
directly constructible.

<note>2022-09-23; Reflector poll</note>
<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll. Send to SG16 (then maybe LEWG).
</p>

<note>2022-09-28; SG16 responds</note>
<p>
SG16 agrees that the codecvt facets mentioned in LWG3767
"<tt>codecvt&lt;char<i>N</i>_t, char8_t, mbstate_t&gt;</tt>
incorrectly added to locale" are intended to be invariant
with respect to locale. Unanimously in favor.
</p>

<note>Issaquah 2023-02-10; LWG issue processing</note>
<p>
Removing these breaks most code using them today, because the most obvious
way to use them is via <tt>use_facet</tt> on a locale, which would throw
if they're removed (and because they were guaranteed to be present, code
using them might have not bothered to check for them using <tt>has_facet</tt>).
Instead of removing them, deprecate the guarantee that they're always present
(so move them to <sref ref="[depr.locale.category]"/>).
Don't bother changing the destructor.
Victor to update wording.

<note>2023-02-10; Victor Zverovich comments and provides improved wording</note>
<p>
Per today's LWG discussion the following changes have been implemented in revised wording:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deprecated the facets instead of removing them (also <tt>_byname</tt> variants which were previously missed).</p></li>
<li><p>Removed the changes to facet dtor since with deprecation it's no longer critical to provide other ways to access them.</p></li>
</ul>
