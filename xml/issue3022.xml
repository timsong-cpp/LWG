<p>
Given two incomplete types, <tt>base</tt> and <tt>derived</tt>, that will have
the expected base/derived relationship when complete, the trait
<tt>is_convertible</tt> claims to support instantiation with pointers to
these types (as pointers to incomplete types are, themselves,
complete), yet will give a different answer when the types are
complete vs. when they are incomplete.
<p/>
We should require pointers (and pointers to pointers etc.)
point to a complete type, unless one is a pointer to
<i>cv</i>-<tt>void</tt>. We may also want some weasel-wording to
permit pointers to arrays-of-unknown-bound, and pointers
to <i>cv</i>-qualified variants of the same incomplete type.
