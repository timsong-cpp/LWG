<p>
The effects of <tt>packaged_task::reset()</tt> result in memory allocation, but
don't allow a user to provide an allocator.
<p/>
<tt>packaged_task::reset()</tt> needs to be overloaded like so:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Alloc&gt;  
void reset(const Alloc&amp;);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Alternatively, the effects of <tt>reset()</tt> need to require the same allocator is used 
as at construction, which would require the constructor to store the allocator for later use.
<p/>
I like to remark that GCC at the moment uses the second option, i.e. the allocator passed to the constructor 
(if any) is used to create the new shared state, because this didn't require any change to the
interface.

Handed over to SG1.

<p>
No strong opinions in SG1, and this is really an LWG issue.  Back to you.

<note>2016-08-02 Chicago, Billy O'Neal comments and suggests concrete wording</note>
<p>
Talked this over with Alasdair, who says there's little desire to allow the <tt>packaged_task</tt> to 
be change allocators after initial construction, making what libstdc++ does already the "right thing." 
A clarification note is still necessary to indicate that the allocator supplied to the 
<tt>allocator_arg_t</tt> constructor is to be used.

<p>Alisdair requests change to Review.</p>

<note>2017-03-03, Kona</note>
<p>This was resolved by adopting <iref ref="2921"/>, which removed the constructors that take allocators.</p>
