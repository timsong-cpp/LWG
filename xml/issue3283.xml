<title>Types satisfying <tt>input_iterator</tt> but not <tt>equality_comparable</tt> look like 
C++17 output iterators</title>

<p>
In C++20, if an iterator doesn't define <em>all</em> of the associated iterator types (value, 
category, reference, and difference), the primary <tt>std::iterator_traits</tt> template picks 
a category based on structural conformance to a set of implementation-defined concepts that 
capture the old iterator requirements tables. (See <sref ref="[iterator.traits]"/>.) In C++17, 
input iterators were required to be equality-comparable with themselves. In C++20 that is not 
the case, so such iterators must not be given <tt>intput_iterator_tag</tt> as a category. 
They don't, so that's all well and good.
<p/>
However, <sref ref="[iterator.traits]"/> concludes that, since such an iterator cannot be an 
input iterator, it must therefor be an <em>output</em> iterator, and it assigns it a category 
of <tt>std::output_iterator_tag</tt>. It does this even if there is a nested 
<tt>iterator_category</tt> typedef declaring the iterator to be input. (This will happen 
frequently as C++20 iterators don't require iterators to declare their reference type, for 
instance.) This will be extremely confusing to users who, understandably, will be at a loss to 
understand why the legacy STL algorithms think their iterator is an output iterator when they 
have clearly stated that the iterator is input!
<p/>
The fix is to tweak the specification such that the output category is assigned to an iterator 
only (a) if it declares its category to be output, or (b) it doesn't specify a category at all. 
The result, for the user, is that their iterator simply won't look like a C++17 iterator at all, 
because it isn't!
<p/>
Suggested priority: P1. We can't make this change after C++20 because it would be an observable change.
<p/>
This fix has been implemented in range-v3.
