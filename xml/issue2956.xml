This is from editorial issue <a href="http://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/1620">#1620</a>:
<p/>
Since the resolution of US-78 was applied (as part of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0492r2">P0492R2</a>),
<tt>std::filesystem::absolute(path, base)</tt> no longer exists. However, <tt>std::filesystem::canonical</tt> 
is still defined in terms of <tt>absolute(p, base)</tt>.
</p>

<note>2017-06-27 P1 after 5 positive votes on c++std-lib</note>
<p>
Davis Herring: This needs to be P1 &mdash; due to a wording gap in <a href="http://wg21.link/p0492r2">P0492R2</a>, 2 out of the 
3 overloads of <tt>filesystem::canonical()</tt> have bad signatures and are unimplementable.
