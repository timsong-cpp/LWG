<title><i>Expects:</i> element should be specified in one place</title>

<p>
<sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/>/p3.4 specifies the <i>Expects:</i> element as "the conditions (sometimes termed preconditions) 
that the function assumes to hold whenever it is called". This is nonsensical (functions can't "assume" things because 
they're not sentient), and more to the point it says nothing about what happens if those conditions don't hold. This is 
a serious problem because the whole point of introducing <i>Expects:</i> was to correct the vagueness of <i>Requires:</i> on 
exactly that point.
<p/>
<sref ref="[res.on.required]"/>/p2 is more explicit: "Violation of any preconditions specified in a function's <i>Expects:</i> 
element results in undefined behavior." However, I think putting the actual meaning of the <i>Expects:</i> element in a subclause 
called "Requires paragraph", 21 pages away from where <i>Expects:</i> is nominally specified, is asking too much of the reader. 
Splitting the specification of <i>Requires:</i> into two places 21 pages apart also seems needlessly obtuse, but that's less pressing 
since <i>Requires:</i> should be going away soon.
