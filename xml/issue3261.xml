<p>
<tt>std::basic_regex</tt> and <tt>std::match_results</tt> have <tt>noexcept</tt> move construction, and 
<tt>std::basic_regex</tt> has <tt>noexcept</tt> move assignment, but both of them have throwing swaps. We 
probably need an <i>Expects:</i> or something to say that <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt> doesn't 
throw through these operations. We probably also need <tt>match_results::operator=</tt> to 
respect <tt>propagate_on_container_move_assignment</tt> (and maybe the copy ctor respect 
<tt>propagate_on_container_copy_assignment</tt>).
