<p>
Right now <tt>inplace_vector::swap</tt> has only a declaration in the class synopsis; it doesn't
specify what the behavior of <tt>swap</tt> for <tt>inplace_vector</tt>s actually is. So I think
the behavior ends up being governed by <sref ref="[container.reqmts]"/>, which are written from
the point of view of a container that manages an external heap allocation so that swapping
containers doesn't touch the elements at all, just changes their ownership.
<p/>
<tt>inplace_vector::swap</tt> actually works more like <tt>array::swap</tt>, which has its own
specification in <sref ref="[array.members]"/>, where it is defined in terms of <tt>std::swap_ranges</tt>.
The <tt>std::swap_ranges</tt> algorithm (<sref ref="[alg.swap]"/>) has a precondition! This
precondition is missing from <tt>inplace_vector::swap</tt>.
<p/>
That is, I think we currently have no wording that explains why
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource mr1;
std::inplace_vector&lt;std::pmr::vector&lt;int&gt;, 2&gt; v1, v2;
v1.emplace_back(1, &amp;mr1);
v2.emplace_back(1);
v1.swap(v2);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
is undefined behavior. The current spec seems to say this Just Works, even though it physically
cannot work because <tt>v1[0]</tt> and <tt>v2[0]</tt> don't dynamically meet the semantic requirements
of being "swappable with" each other, and <tt>v1.swap(v2)</tt> is necessarily going to try to swap them.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4988"/>.
