<p>
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1902r1">P1902R1</a> introduced the feature test macro 
<tt>__cpp_lib_nothrow_convertible</tt>, but every other example in SD-6 of a feature test macro 
testing for the presence of a single type trait <em>FOO</em> is named <tt>__cpp_lib_<em>FOO</em></tt>. 
This macro should be renamed <tt>__cpp_lib_is_nothrow_convertible</tt>.
<p/>
This naming convention should probably be documented in SD-6 as policy.

<note>2019-12-21 Issue Prioritization</note>
<p>Status to Tentatively Ready and priority to 0 after seven positive votes on the reflector.
A convincing argument was that currently no vendor had published a release with the previous
feature macro.</p>
