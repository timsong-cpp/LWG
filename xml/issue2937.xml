See discussion on the LWG mailing list with subject "Is equivalent("existing_thing", "not_existing_thing") an error?", abreviated below:
<p/>
Billy O'Neal:

<blockquote>
<p>
The existing "an error is reported" effects say that an error is reported for <tt>!exists(p1) &amp;&amp; !exists(p2)</tt>, but 
I'm not sure that treating <tt>equivalent("existing_thing", "not_existing_thing")</tt> as "<tt>false</tt>, no error" makes any more 
sense than for <tt>equivalent("not_existing_thing", "not_existing_thing")</tt>.
<p/>
It's also unfortunate that the current spec requires reporting an error for <tt>is_other(p1) &amp;&amp; is_other(p2)</tt> &mdash; 
there's no reason that you can't give a sane answer for paths to NT pipes. (Do POSIX FIFOs give garbage answers here?)

Davis Herring:

<p>
I'm fine with an error if either path does not exist. See also Late 29: I would much prefer
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
file_identity identity(const path&amp;, bool resolve = true);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
which would of course produce an error if the path did not exist (or, with the default <tt>resolve</tt>, was a broken symlink).
<p/>
See Late 30 and 32 (31 has been resolved). FIFOs pose no trouble: you can even <tt>fstat(2)</tt> on the naked file 
descriptors produced by <tt>pipe(2)</tt>. (That said, I observe the strange inconsistency that Linux but not macOS 
gives both ends of a pipe the same <tt>st_ino</tt>.)
<p/>
POSIX has no reason that I know of to treat any file type specially for <tt>equivalent()</tt>.
</p>

Billy O'Neal:

<blockquote>
<p>
I think such a <tt>file_identity</tt> feature would be useful but we can always add it in addition to <tt>equivalent</tt> 
post-C++17.

<p>
Looks good to me. Maybe submit this as an issue right away in the hopes it can go in C++17?

<li><p>Make the following edits to <sref ref="[fs.op.equivalent]"/>:</p>

<blockquote>

respectively.</del>

<del>-2- <i>Effects:</i> Determines <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt>. If <tt>(!exists(s1) &amp;&amp; !exists(s2)) || (is_other(s1) &amp;&amp;
