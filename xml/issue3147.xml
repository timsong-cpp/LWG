<sref ref="[macro.names]"/>/2 forbids a translation unit to define names "lexically identical to [&hellip;] the 
<i>attribute-token</i>s described in <sref ref="[dcl.attr]"/>." We recently added the attribute-tokens <tt>likely</tt> 
and <tt>unlikely</tt> (<sref ref="[dcl.attr.likelihood]"/>). These names are in extremely wide use as function-like 
macros in the open source community, forbidding users to define them breaks large amounts of code. (Reportedly 
Chromium contains 19 definitions each of "likely" and "unlikely" as function-like macros.)
<p/>
Indeed, this issue came up during EWG discussion of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0479R1">P0479R1</a> "Attributes 
for Likely and Unlikely Statements" in Kona, and EWG decided to keep the names "likely" and "unlikely" for the attribute 
tokens since the usage wouldn't conflict with defining them as function-like macros. <sref ref="[macro.names]"/>/2 should 
not break large amounts of existing code that doesn't actually conflict with the use of the <tt>[[likely]]</tt> and 
<tt>[[unlikely]]</tt> attributes.
