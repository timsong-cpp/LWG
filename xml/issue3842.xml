<sref ref="[time.format]"/> says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] Giving a <i>precision</i> specification in the <i>chrono-format-spec</i> is valid only for 
<tt>std::chrono::duration</tt> types where the representation type
<tt>Rep</tt> is a floating-point type.

<i>chrono-format-spec</i> contains a <i>precision</i> specification. [&hellip;]

<p>
It's unclear whether the restriction in the first sentence applies to all types, or only duration types. 
The second sentence seems to restrict the exceptional case to only types with a non-floating-point <tt>Rep</tt>, 
but what about types with no <tt>Rep</tt> type at all?
<p/>
Can you use a precision with <tt>sys_time&lt;duration&lt;float&gt;&gt;</tt>? That is not a <tt>duration</tt> type at all, 
so does the restriction apply? What about <tt>hh_mm_ss&lt;duration&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt>? That's not a 
<tt>duration</tt> type, but it uses one, and its <tt>Rep</tt> is not a floating-point type. 
What about <tt>sys_info</tt>? That's not a <tt>duration</tt> and doesn't have any associated <tt>duration</tt>, 
or <tt>Rep</tt> type.
<p/>
What is the intention here?
<p/>
Less importantly, I don't like the use of <tt>Rep</tt> here. That's the template parameter of the 
<tt>duration</tt> class template, but that name isn't in scope here. Why aren't we talking about the 
<tt>duration</tt> type's <tt>rep</tt> type, which is the public name for it? Or about a concrete 
specialization <tt>duration&lt;Rep, Period&gt;</tt>, instead of the class template?
<p/>
The suggested change below would preserve the intended meaning, but with more &hellip; <i>precision</i>.
