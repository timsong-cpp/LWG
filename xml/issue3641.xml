<p>
During the 2019 Cologne meeting the papers <paper num="P1614R2"/> "The Mothership has
Landed" and <paper num="P0645R10"/> "Text Formatting" have been accepted. P1614R2 adds
<tt>operator==</tt> to <tt>to_chars_result</tt> and <tt>from_chars_result</tt>. P0645R10 
adds a similar type <tt>format_to_n_result</tt> <em>without</em> an <tt>operator==</tt>. 
LWG <iref ref="3373"/> reaffirms these three types are similar by ensuring they can be used in
structured bindings.
<p/>
It seems due to accepting P1614R2 and P0645R10 during the same meeting the addition of 
<tt>operator==</tt> wasn't applied to <tt>format_to_n_result</tt>. I propose to add 
<tt>operator==</tt> to <tt>format_to_n_result</tt> to keep these types similar.
<p/>
The <tt>Out</tt> template argument of <tt>format_to_n_result</tt> is unconstrained. Since
it's returned from <tt>format_to_n</tt> it's indirectly constrained to an 
<tt>output_iterator</tt>. An <tt>output_iterator</tt> doesn't require <tt>equality_comparable</tt>,
thus the defaulted <tt>operator==</tt> can be defined deleted.

Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
Several votes for NAD. Unclear why <code>to_chars_result</code> is equality
comparable, but whatever the reason, this is unrelated to them and doesn't
need to be.
