<sref ref="[format.formatter.spec]"/>/3 says that the library provides a specialization of 
`enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization` with value `true` corresponding to each library-provided 
specialization of `formatter`, unless otherwise specified. Although it actually states 
"for each type `T`", the intent is that partial specializations are also provided corresponding to 
library-provided partial specializations of formatter.
<p/>
<sref ref="[container.adaptors.format]"/>/1 says the library provides a partial specialization of 
`formatter` for each of the container adaptor templates `priority_queue`, `queue`, and `stack`. 
Together with <sref ref="[format.formatter.spec]"/>/3, that means that e.g. 
<tt>enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization&lt;stack&lt;T&gt;&gt; == true</tt>. Formatting a stack of 
that type will enable the nonlocking optimization even if 
<tt>enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization&lt;T&gt; == false</tt>. To avoid this, the author of `T` 
must partially specialize `enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization` to `false` for all container 
adaptors when they adapt a container of `T`.
<p/>
It is clearly not the design intent that programmers must explicitly opt out of the nonlocking 
optimization, so this is a defect that LWG should correct. Since <paper num="P3235R3"/> was applied 
as a Defect Report to C++23, the resolution of this issue should be so applied as well.
<p/>
<b>Suggested Resolution:</b>
<p/>
LEWG was reticent to apply the optimization to general ranges &mdash; ostensibly due to the possibility 
of deadlock in program-defined iterator operations &mdash; but apparently unconcerned about the iterators 
of program-defined containers nor the fancy pointers of program-defined allocators. It seems consistent 
with that design to ignore the "container" part of "container adaptors" and only pay attention to the 
elements that are going to be formatted. (I have prototyped this resolution on MSVCSTL, albeit slightly 
modified since neither MSVC nor Clang like this partial specialization form.)

<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4988"/>.

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[container.adaptors.format]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- For each of <tt>queue</tt>, <tt>priority_queue</tt>, and <tt>stack</tt>, the library provides the 
following <del>formatter</del> specialization<ins>s</ins> where <tt><i>adaptor-type</i></tt> is the 
name of the template:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
namespace std {
  template&lt;class charT, class T, formattable&lt;charT&gt; Container, class... U&gt;
  struct formatter&lt;<i>adaptor-type</i>&lt;T, Container, U...&gt;, charT&gt; {
    [&hellip;]
  };

  <ins>template&lt;class T, class Container, class... U&gt;</ins>
  <ins>constexpr bool enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization&lt;<i>adaptor-type</i>&lt;T, Container, U...&gt;&gt; =</ins>
    <ins>enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization&lt;T&gt;;</ins>
}
</pre></blockquote>
