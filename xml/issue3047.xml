<title><tt>atomic</tt> compound assignment operators can cause undefined behavior when corresponding 
<tt>fetch_<i>meow</i></tt> members don't</title>

<p>
Given <tt>atomic&lt;int&gt; meow{INT_MAX};</tt>, <tt>meow.fetch_add(1)</tt> has well-defined behavior because <sref ref="[atomics.types.int]"/> p7 says that
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Remarks:</i> For signed integer types, arithmetic is defined to use two's complement representation. There are no undefined results.
</p>
</blockquote>
but <tt>meow += 1</tt> and <tt>++meow</tt> have undefined behavior, because these operator functions are defined (by, respectively, 
<sref ref="[atomics.types.int]"/> p8 and <sref ref="[atomics.types.memop]"/>) to be equivalent to <tt>return fetch_add(1) + 1;</tt>, 
and so the addition of 1 to the result of <tt>fetch_add</tt> &mdash; which causes an integer overflow in this case &mdash; occurs 
outside the protection of <tt>fetch_add</tt> magic. Additionally, the return value might differ from what <tt>fetch_add</tt> actually
wrote since that addition isn't required to use two's complement. This seems like a trap for the unwary. Is it intended?
<p/>
A similar issue affects the <tt>atomic&lt;T*&gt;</tt> partial specialization for pointers.
