<p>
For forward iterators we have very clear wording regarding the restricted domain of <tt>operator==</tt>
in <sref ref="[forward.iterators]"/> p2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The domain of <tt>==</tt> for forward iterators is that of iterators over the same underlying sequence. 
However, value-initialized iterators may be compared and shall compare equal to other value-initialized 
iterators of the same type. [<i>Note:</i> Value-initialized iterators behave as if they refer past the 
end of the same empty sequence. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But for the relational operators of random access iterators specified in 
<sref ref="[random.access.iterators]"/>, Table <sref ref="[tab:randomaccessiterator]"/>,
no such domain constraints are clearly defined, except that we can infer that they are
similarly constrained as the difference of the compared iterators by means of the
operational semantics of <tt>operator&lt;</tt>.
</p>

<note>2019-07-29; Casey comments and provides wording</note>
<p>
Change the "Operational Semantics" column of the "<tt>a &lt; b</tt>" row of [tab:randomaccessiterator] to 
"<ins><i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to: <tt>return</tt></ins> <tt>b - a &gt; 0</tt><ins>;</ins>
<p/>
It then follows that <tt>a &lt; b</tt> is required to be well-defined over the domain for which 
<tt>b - a</tt> is required to be well-defined, which is the set of pairs <tt>(x, y)</tt> such that 
there exists a value <tt>n</tt> of type difference_type such that <tt>x + n == b</tt>.
</p>

<p>
P3, but some hesitation to make it Immediate, therefore moving to Ready.
