<sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>/69 says "An implementation shall implement them so as to take amortized constant time." 
followed by a list of operations that includes the newly added <tt>append_range</tt> and <tt>prepend_range</tt>. 
Obviously these operations cannot be implemented in amortized constant time.
<p/>
Because the actual complexity of these operations are already specified in the concrete container specification, 
we can just exclude them here.
