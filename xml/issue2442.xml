<p>
When LWG <iref ref="891"/> overhauled <tt>call_once()</tt>'s specification, it used <tt>decay_copy()</tt>, following 
LWG <iref ref="929"/>'s overhaul of <tt>thread</tt>'s constructor.
<p/>
In <tt>thread</tt>'s constructor, this is necessary and critically important. <sref ref="[thread.thread.constr]"/>/5 
"The new thread of execution executes <tt><i>INVOKE</i>(<i>DECAY_COPY</i>(std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f)), 
<i>DECAY_COPY</i>(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args))...)</tt> 
with the calls to <tt><i>DECAY_COPY</i></tt> being evaluated in the constructing thread." requires the parent thread 
to copy arguments for the child thread to access.
<p/>
In <tt>call_once()</tt>, this is unnecessary and harmful. It's unnecessary because <tt>call_once()</tt> doesn't transfer 
arguments between threads. It's harmful because:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>decay_copy()</tt> returns a prvalue. Given <tt>meow(int&amp;)</tt>, <tt>meow(i)</tt> can be called directly, 
but <tt>call_once(flag, meow, i)</tt> won't compile.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>decay_copy()</tt> moves from modifiable rvalues. Given <tt>purr(const unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;&amp;)</tt>, 
<tt>purr(move(up))</tt> won't modify <tt>up</tt>. (This is observable, because moved-from <tt>unique_ptr</tt>s are 
guaranteed empty.) However, <tt>call_once(flag, purr, move(up))</tt> will leave <tt>up</tt> empty after the first active 
execution. Observe the behavioral difference &mdash; if <tt>purr()</tt> is directly called like this repeatedly until it 
doesn't throw an exception, each call will observe <tt>up</tt> unchanged. With <tt>call_once()</tt>, the second active 
execution will observe <tt>up</tt> to be empty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<tt>call_once()</tt> should use perfect forwarding without <tt>decay_copy()</tt>, in order to avoid interfering with the call like this.

Handed over to SG1.

<p>
Looks good to us, but this is really an LWG issue.

<p>LWG 2442 call_once shouldn't decay_copy</p>
<p>STL summarizes the SG1 minutes.</p>
<p>Marshall: Jonathan updated all the issues with SG1 status last night. Except this one.</p>
<p>STL summarizes the issue.</p>
<p>Dietmar: Of course, call_once has become useless.</p>
<p>STL: With magic statics.</p>
<p>Jonathan: Magic statics can't be per object, which I use in future.</p>
<p>Marshall: I see why you are removing the MoveConstructible on the arguments, but what about Callable?</p>
<p>STL: That's a type named Callable, which we will no longer decay_copy. We're still requiring the INVOKE expression to be valid.</p>
<p>Marshall: Okay. Basically, ripping the decay_copy out of here.</p>
<p>STL: I recall searching the Standard for other occurrences and I believe this is the only inappropriate use of decay_copy.</p>
<p>Marshall: We do the decay_copy.</p>
<p>Jonathan: Us too.</p>
<p>Marshall: What do people think?</p>
<p>Jonathan: I think STL's right. In the use I was mentioning inside futures, I actually pass them by reference_wrapper and pointers, to avoid the decay causing problems. Inside the call_once, I then extract the args. So I've had to work around this and didn't realize it was a defect.</p>
<p>Marshall: What do people think is the right resolution?</p>
<p>STL: I would like to see Immediate.</p>
<p>Hwrd: No objections to Immediate.</p>
<p>Marshall: Bill is nodding.</p>
<p>PJP: He said it. Everything STL says applies to our other customers.</p>
<p>Marshall: Any objections to Immediate?</p>
<p>Jonathan: I can't see any funky implementations where a decay_copy would be necessary?</p>
<p>Marshall: 6 votes for Immediate, 0 opposed, 0 abstaining.</p>
