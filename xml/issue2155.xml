<title>Macro <tt>__bool_true_false_are_defined</tt> should be removed</title>

<p>
Since C99, the C standard describes a macro named  <tt>__bool_true_false_are_defined</tt>.
<p/>
In the process of harmonizing C++11 with C99, this name became part of the C++ standard.
<p/>
I propose that all mention of this name should be removed from the C and C++ standards.
<p/>
Here's the problem: The name was originally proposed as a transition tool, so that the headers for a 
project could contain lines like the following.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#if !defined(__bool_true_false_are_defined)
#define bool int /* or whatever */
#define true 1
#define false 0
#endif
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Then when the project was compiled by a "new" compiler that implemented <tt>bool</tt> as defined by the 
evolving C++98 or C99 standards, those lines would be skipped; but when compiled by an "old" compiler that 
didn't yet provide <tt>bool</tt>, <tt>true</tt>, and <tt>false</tt>, then the <tt>#define</tt>'s would provide a
simulation that worked for most purposes.
<p/>
It turns out that there is an unfortunate ambiguity in the name.  One interpretation is as shown above, but 
a different reading says "bool, true, and false are #define'd", i.e. that the meaning of the macro is to
assert that these names are macros (not built-in) ... which is true in C, but not in C++.
<p/>
In C++11, the name appears in parentheses followed by a stray period, so
some editorial change is needed in any event:
<p/>
<sref ref="[support.runtime]"/> para 1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Headers <tt>&lt;csetjmp&gt;</tt> (nonlocal jumps), <tt>&lt;csignal&gt;</tt> (signal handling), <tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt> 
(alignment), <tt>&lt;cstdarg&gt;</tt> (variable arguments), <tt>&lt;cstdbool&gt;</tt> (<tt>__bool_true_false_are_defined</tt>). 
<tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> (runtime environment <tt>getenv()</tt>, <tt>system()</tt>), and <tt>&lt;ctime&gt;</tt> 
(system clock <tt>clock()</tt>, <tt>time()</tt>) provide further compatibility with C code.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, para 2 says
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"The contents of these headers are the same as the Standard C library headers <tt>&lt;setjmp.h&gt;</tt>, 
<tt>&lt;signal.h&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</tt>, 
<tt>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt>, and <tt>&lt;time.h&gt;</tt>, respectively, with the following 
changes:",
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and para 8 says 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"The header <tt>&lt;cstdbool&gt;</tt> and the header <tt>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</tt> shall 
not define macros named <tt>bool</tt>, <tt>true</tt>, or <tt>false</tt>."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus para 8 doesn't exempt the C++ implementation from the arguably clear requirement of the C standard, to 
provide a macro named <tt>__bool_true_false_are_defined</tt> defined to be 1.
<p/>
Real implementations of the C++ library differ, so the user cannot count upon any consistency; furthermore, the 
usefulness of the transition tool has faded long ago.
<p/>
That's why my suggestion is that both C and C++ standards should eliminate any mention of 
<tt>__bool_true_false_are_defined</tt>.  In that case, the name belongs to implementers to provide, or not, as 
they choose.

<p>
Moved to Open.
</p>
<p>
While not strictly necessary, the clean-up look good.
</p>
<p>
We would like to hear from our C liaison before moving on this issue though.

LWG agrees. Jonathan provides wording.

<note>2017-03-04, Kona</note>
<p>The reference to &lt;cstdbool&gt; in p2 needs to be struck as well. Continue the discussion on the reflector once the DIS is available.</p>

<note>2019-03-18; Daniel comments and eliminates previously proposed wording</note>
<p>
With the approval of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0619r4">P0619R4</a> in Rapperswil, the offending wording has now been eliminated 
from the working draft. I suggest to close this issue as: Resolved by <a href="https://wg21.link/p0619r4">P0619R4</a>.
