<p>The class template <tt>lock_guard</tt> was made variadic. This is abi-breaking, and confusing because one-argument 
<tt>lock_guard</tt>s have a typedef <tt>mutex_type</tt> but <tt>lock_guard</tt>s with more than one argument don't. There's 
no need to try to shoehorn this functionality into one type.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Revert the changes to <tt>lock_guard</tt>, and introduce a new variadic class template 
<tt>vlock_guard</tt> that doesn't have the <tt>mutex_type</tt> typedef at all.</p>

<p>This was the subject of intense discussion in Issaquah, and a joint LEG/LEWG session agreed on this approach.</p>
