In order to replace some uses of C arrays with <tt>std::array</tt>, we need it
to be possible to cast from a <tt>std::array&lt;&gt;</tt> to an equivalent C array.
Core wording doesn't appear to be in quite the right state to allow
casting, but if we specify that appropriate types are
layout-compatible, we can at least write:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
union {
  array&lt;array&lt;array&lt;int, 2&gt;, 3&gt;, 4&gt; arr;
  int carr[4][3][2];
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
to view memory as the other type: C++14 CD [class.mem]p18.
</p>
I believe it's sufficient to add "<tt>array&lt;T, N&gt;</tt> shall be
layout-compatible (<sref ref="[basic.types]"/>) with <tt>T[N]</tt>." to 
<sref ref="[array.overview]"/>, but we might also need some extension to 
<sref ref="[class.mem]"/> to address the possibility of layout-compatibility 
between struct and array types.
<p>
I checked that libc++ on MacOS already implements this, although it
would be good for someone else to double-check; I haven't checked any
other standard libraries.

<rationale>
The desire to use <tt>std::array</tt> like this seems like an "XY problem". The goal 
should be "replace C arrays" not "replace C arrays with <tt>std::array</tt>", because 
<tt>std::array</tt> is not suitable here. There are superior solutions being proposed, 
and will be available in a future version of C++ (e.g. using <tt>mdspan</tt> as a 
multi-dimensional view on an array).
