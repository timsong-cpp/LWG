From issue <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/4553">cplusplus/draft#4553</a> 
which is considered non-editorial.
<p/>
Currently, <tt>std::launder</tt> has a precondition that the pointed to object must be within 
its lifetime. However, per the example added by <paper num="P0593R6"/>, it's probably intended 
that the result of <tt>std::launder</tt> should be allowed to point to an array element 
subobject whose lifetime has not started yet.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4986"/>.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[ptr.launder]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class T&gt; [[nodiscard]] constexpr T* launder(T* p) noexcept;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <i>Mandates</i>: <tt>!is_function_v&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp; !is_void_v&lt;T&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt>.
<p/>
-2- <i>Preconditions</i>: <tt>p</tt> represents the address <i>A</i> of a byte in memory. 
An object <i>X</i> <del>that is within its lifetime (<sref ref="[basic.life]"/>) and</del> 
whose type is similar (<sref ref="[conv.qual]"/>) to <tt>T</tt> is located at the address 
<i>A</i><ins>, and is either within its lifetime (<sref ref="[basic.life]"/>) or is an array 
element subobject whose containing array object is within its lifetime</ins>. All bytes of storage 
that would be reachable through (<sref ref="[basic.compound]"/>) the result are reachable through 
<tt>p</tt>.
<p/>
-3- Returns: A value of type <tt>T*</tt> that points to <i>X</i>.
