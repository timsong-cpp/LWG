<b>Addresses GB 62</b>
<p/>
There is an implicit precondition on most <tt>shared_future</tt> operations that 
<tt>valid() == true</tt>, 30.6.7p3. The list of exempted functions seems copied 
directly from class <tt>future</tt>, and would also include copy operations for 
<tt>shared_futures</tt>, which are copyable. Similarly, this would be a wide 
contract that cannot throw, so those members would be marked <tt>noexcept</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Revise p3:
<p/>
"The effect of calling any member function other than the move constructor, the copy 
constructor, the destructor, the move-assignment operator, the copy-assignment 
operator, or <tt>valid()</tt> on a <tt>shared_future</tt> object for which 
<tt>valid() == false</tt> is undefined." [&hellip;]
<p/>
Add <tt>noexcept</tt> specification to the copy constructor and copy-assignment operator, 
in the class definition and where those members are specified.
</p>

<note>2016-11-10, Zhihao Yuan comments and provides wording</note>
<p>
This resolution should close LWG <iref ref="2697"/> as well, but that one was filed 
against concurrent TS.
