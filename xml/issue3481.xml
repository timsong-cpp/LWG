<p>
The <tt>viewable_range concept</tt> (<sref ref="[range.refinements]"/>) and the <tt>views:all</tt> 
range adaptor (<sref ref="[range.all]"/>) are duals: <tt>viewable_range</tt> is intended to admit 
exactly types <tt>T</tt> for which <tt>views::all(declval&lt;T&gt;())</tt> is well-formed. (Recall 
that <tt>views::all(<i>meow</i>)</tt> is a prvalue whose type models <tt>view</tt> when it is 
well-formed.) Before the addition of move-only view types to the design, this relationship was in 
place (modulo an incredibly pathological case: a <tt>volatile</tt> value of a view type with 
<tt>volatile</tt>-qualified <tt>begin</tt> and <tt>end</tt> models <tt>viewable_range</tt> but is 
rejected by <tt>views::all</tt> unless it also has a <tt>volatile</tt>-qualified copy constructor 
and copy assignment operator). Adding move-only views to the design punches a bigger hole, however: 
<tt>viewable_range</tt> admits lvalues of move-only view types for which <tt>views::all</tt> is 
ill-formed because these lvalues cannot be decay-copied.
<p/>
It behooves us to restore the correspondence between <tt>viewable_range</tt> and <tt>views::all</tt> 
so that instantiations of components constrained with <tt>viewable_range</tt> (which often appears 
indirectly as <tt>views::all_t&lt;R&gt;</tt> in deduction guides) continue to be well-formed when 
the constraints are satisfied.
