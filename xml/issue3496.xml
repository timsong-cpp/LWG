<sref ref="[syncstream.syncbuf.members]"/> p5 says "May call member functions of <tt>wrapped</tt> while holding a 
lock uniquely associated with <tt>wrapped</tt>."
<p/>
It's unclear what "uniquely associated" means. Is it required to be a one-to-one mapping, so that every 
<tt>streambuf*</tt> that is wrapped is associated with a different lock?
<p/>
I believe the intention is only that for a given <tt>streambuf*</tt> every <tt>syncbuf</tt> that wraps it 
uses the same lock. It is supposed to be OK for the same lock to be used for more than one <tt>streambuf*</tt> 
(e.g. using a table of <tt>N</tt> locks which are indexed by a hash of the <tt>streambuf* value)</tt>. 
The current wording can be interpreted to forbid that implementation.
