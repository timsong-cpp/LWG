<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/10 says that unless otherwise specified, "no <tt>swap()</tt> function invalidates 
any references, pointers, or iterators referring to the elements of the containers being swapped. [<i>Note:</i> The <tt>end()</tt> 
iterator does not refer to any element, so it may be invalidated. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]". However, move constructors and move 
assignment operators aren't given similar invalidation guarantees. The guarantees need several exceptions, so I do not believe 
that blanket language like /11 "Unless otherwise specified (either explicitly or by defining a function in terms of other functions), 
invoking a container member function or passing a container as an argument to a library function shall not invalidate iterators to, 
or change the values of, objects within that container." is applicable.

<p>
General agreeement on intent, several wording nits and additional paragraphs to hit.
</p>
<p>
STL to provide updated wording.  Move to Open.

AM: in the proposed wording, I'd like to mention that the iterators now refer to elements of a different container. 
I think we're saying something like this somewhere. JY: There's some wording like that for swap I think. TK: It's also in 
<tt>list::splice()</tt>. DK to JY: 23.2.1p9.
<p/>
VV: The issue says that STL was going to propose new wording. Has he done that? AM: I believe we're looking at that. 
GR: The request touches on multiple paragraphs, and this PR has only one new paragraph, so this looks like it's not up-to-date. 
MC: This was last updated a year ago in Issaquah.
<p/>
<b>Conclusion</b>: Skip, not up to date.

<a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/std-proposals/2023/01/5439.php">observed</a>
that the proposed resolution of this issue contradicts with changes made by
LWG <iref ref="2839"/>. Specifially, the current draft does not require
container elements to be preserved on self-move-assignment.
If this issue is accepted, it would either need to allow
iterator invalidation on self-move-assignment or remove the
"If <tt>a</tt> and <tt>rv</tt> do not refer to the same object"
changes added to the container requirements by LWG <iref ref="2839"/>.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/10 change as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
-10- Unless otherwise specified (see 23.2.4.1, 23.2.5.1, 23.3.3.4, and 23.3.7.5) all container types defined in this
Clause meet the following additional requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
[&hellip;]
</p></li>
<li><p>
no copy constructor or assignment operator of a returned iterator throws an exception.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<ins>no move constructor (or move assignment operator when 
<tt>allocator_traits&lt;allocator_type&gt;::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value</tt> is true) of a container 
(except for <tt>array</tt>) invalidates any references, pointers, or iterators referring to the elements of the source container. 
[<i>Note:</i> The <tt>end()</tt> iterator does not refer to any element, so it may be invalidated. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</ins>
</p></li>
<li><p>
no <tt>swap()</tt> function throws an exception.
