<p>
The permission denoted by [namespace.std]/3 should be limited to program-defined types.

<note>2022-08-24; LWG telecon</note>
<p>Each variable template that grants permission to specialize already
states requirements more precisely than proposed here anyway.
For example, <code>disable_sized_range</code> only allows it for
cv-unqualified program-defined types.
Adding less precise wording here wouldn't be an improvement.
Add a note to make it clear we didn't just forget to say something here,
and to remind us to state requirements for each variable template in future.
