<p><b>Addresses: fund.ts.v2</b></p>
<p>
The specification of <tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt> in <sref ref="[meta.logical]"/> p2 and p5 requires 
<tt>Bi::value</tt> to be convertible to <tt>bool</tt>, but nothing in the specification of the actual behavior of the 
templates, which instead uses the expressions <tt>Bi::value == false</tt> and <tt>Bi::value != false</tt> instead, 
actually requires this conversion.
<p/>
If the intention of this requirement is to allow implementations to pass <tt>Bi::value</tt> directly to <tt>std::conditional</tt>, 
like the sample implementation in P0013R1:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class B1, class B2&gt;
struct and_&lt;B1, B2&gt; : conditional_t&lt;B1::value, B2, B1&gt; { };
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
then it's insufficient in at least two ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Nothing in the specification requires the result of comparing <tt>Bi::value</tt> with <tt>false</tt> to be consistent 
with the result of the implicit conversion. This is similar to LWG <iref ref="2114"/>, though I don't think the 
<tt>BooleanTestable</tt> requirements in that issue's P/R covers <tt>Bi::value == false</tt> and <tt>Bi::value != false</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>More importantly, the above implementation is ill-formed for, e.g., 
<tt>std::conjunction&lt;std::integral_constant&lt;int, 2&gt;, std::integral_constant&lt;int, 4&gt;&gt;</tt>, because converting 2 
to <tt>bool</tt> is a narrowing conversion that is not allowed for non-type template arguments (see <sref ref="[expr.const]"/>/4). 
(Note that GCC currently doesn't diagnose this error at all, and Clang doesn't diagnose it inside system headers.) It's not clear 
whether such constructs are intended to be supported, but if they are not, the current wording doesn't prohibit it.</p></li> 
</ol>

<p>
The resolution for this issue was combined with the resolution for LWG <iref ref="2568"/>, so <iref ref="2568"/> 
resolves this issue here as well.
