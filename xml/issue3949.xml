<p>
<tt>std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</tt> was originally required to have a trivial default constructor and a trivial destructor 
[C++11 <a href="https://wg21.link/N3337#page=1118">N3337</a>: Section [atomics.types.generic], Paragraph 5], 
the same as the integral [C++11 <a href="https://wg21.link/N3337#page=1118">N3337</a>: Section [atomics.types.generic], 
Paragraph 5] and pointer specializations [C++11 <a href="https://wg21.link/N3337#page=1119">N3337</a>: 
Section [atomics.types.generic], Paragraph 6]. <paper num="P0558"/> rearranged the text, 
accidentally (as far as we can tell) removing the constructor and destructor requirements from <tt>std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</tt>,
which has the surprising effect that <tt>std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</tt> has no longer the same constructor/destructor 
guarantees as <tt>std::atomic&lt;int&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
C++20 removed the "trivial default constructor" requirement from all specializations. A specialization for floating-point 
types was added with a trivial destructor [<a href="https://wg21.link/N4861#page=1548">N4861</a>: Section [atomics.types.float], 
Paragraph 2)].
