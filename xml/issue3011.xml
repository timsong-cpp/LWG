<title>Requirements for <tt>assert(<em>E</em>)</tt> inconsistent with C</title>

<p>
The C standard says that the expression in an <tt>assert</tt> must have a scalar type, and implies (or at least allows) 
that the condition is tested by comparison to zero. C++ says that the expression is a constant subexpression if it can 
be contextually converted to <tt>bool</tt>. Those ways to test the condition are not equivalent.
<p/>
It's possible to have expressions that meet the C++ requirements for a constant subexpression, but fail to meet the C 
requirements, and so don't compile.

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

// A toy implementation of assert:
#define assert(E) (void)(((E) != 0) || (abort(), 0))

struct X {
  constexpr explicit operator bool() const { return true; }
};

constexpr bool f(const X&amp; x) {
  assert(x);
  return true;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
C++ says that <tt>assert(x)</tt> is a constant subexpression, but as it doesn't have scalar type it's not even a valid expression.
<p/>
I think either <sref ref="[cassert.syn]"/> or <sref ref="[assertions.assert]"/> should repeat the requirement from C that 
<em>E</em> has scalar type, either normatively or in a note. We should also consider whether "contextually converted to <tt>bool</tt>" 
is the right condition, or if we should use comparison to zero instead.
