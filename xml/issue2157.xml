<title>How does <tt>std::array&lt;T,0&gt;</tt> initialization work when <tt>T</tt> is not default-constructible?</title>

<p>
Objects of <tt>std::array&lt;T,N&gt;</tt> are supposed to be initialized with aggregate initialization (when 
not the destination of a copy or move). This clearly works when <tt>N</tt> is positive. What happens when <tt>N</tt> 
is zero?  To continue using an (inner) set of braces for initialization, a <tt>std::array&lt;T,0&gt;</tt> implementation 
must have an array member of at least one element, and let default initialization take care of those secret elements.  
This cannot work when <tt>T</tt> has a set of constructors and the default constructor is deleted from that set.
Solution: Add a new paragraph in <sref ref="[array.zero]"/>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The unspecified internal structure of array for this case shall allow initializations like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
array&lt;T, 0&gt; a = { };
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and said initializations must be valid even when <tt>T</tt> is not default-constructible.
</p></blockquote>

<note>2012, Portland: Move to Open</note>
<p>
Some discussion to understand the issue, which is that implementations currently have freedom to implement
an empty <tt>array</tt> by holding a dummy element, and so might not support value initialization, which is
surprising when trying to construct an empty container.  However, this is not mandated, it is an unspecified
implementation detail.
</p>

<p>
Jeffrey points out that the implication of <sref ref="[array.overview]"/> is that this initialization syntax
must be supported by empty <tt>array</tt> objects already.  This is a surprising inference that was not
obvious to the room, but consensus is that the reading is accurate, so the proposed resolution is not necessary,
although the increased clarity may be useful.
</p>

<p>
Further observation is that the same clause effectively implies that <tt>T</tt> must always be DefaultConstructible,
regardless of <tt>N</tt> for the same reasons - as an <i>initializer-list</i> may not supply enough values, and the
remaining elements must all be value initialized.
</p>

<p>
Concern that we are dancing angels on the head of pin, and that relying on such subtle implications in wording is
not helpful. We need a clarification of the text in this area, and await wording.

DK: What was the outcome of Portland? AM: Initially we thought we already had the intended behaviour. 
We concluded that <tt>T</tt> must always be <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>, but I'm not sure why. GR: It's p2 in 
<tt>std::array</tt>, "up to <tt>N</tt>". AM: That wording already implies that "<tt>{}</tt>" has to work when <tt>N</tt> 
is zero. But the wording of p2 needs to be fixed to make clear that it does <em>not</em> imply that <tt>T</tt> must be 
<tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>.
<p/>
Conclusion: Update wording, revisit later.

<note>2015-10, Kona Saturday afternoon</note>
<p>MC: How important is this? Can you not just use default construction for empty arrays? </p>
<p>TK: It needs to degenerate properly from a pack. STL agrees.</p> 
<p>JW: Yes, this is important, and we have to make it work.</p>
<p>MC: I hate the words "initialization like". </p>
<p>JW: I'll reword this.</p>
<p>WEB: Can I ask that once JW has reworded this we move it to Review rather than Open? </p>
<p>MC: We'll try to review it in a telecon and hopefully get it to tentatively ready.</p>
<p>STL: Double braces must also work: <tt>array&lt;T, 0&gt; a = {{}};</tt>.</p>
<p>Jonathan to reword.</p>

<note>2018-03-14 Wednesday evening issues processing</note>
<p>Jens suggested that we remove the requirement that <tt>begin() == end() == </tt><i>unique-value</i>, 
specifically the unique value part.</p>

<note>2018-06-14, Jonathan Wakely comments and provides revised wording</note>
<p>
The new wording does not address the 2018-03-14 suggestion from Jens to remove the unique value. It wasn't
clear to me that there was consensus to make that change, and it would be a change in behaviour not just a 
clarification of the existing wording.

<note>2018-08-30, Jonathan revises wording following feedback from Daniel Kruegler and Tim Song.</note>
<p>
Daniel noted that it's undefined to compare iterators from different containers,
so <tt>a.begin() != b.begin()</tt> can't be used. That means whether the iterators
from different containers are unique is unobservable anyway.
We can say they don't share the same underlying sequence, which users they can't compare them
and tells implementors they can't return value-initialized iterators.
<br/>
Tim noted that it's not sufficient to say the unspecified type in a zero-sized array is DefaultConstructible,
it also needs to be constructible from <tt>= {}</tt>. Also, a zero-sized array should be CopyAssignable.
