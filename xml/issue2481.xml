<p>
Paragraph 4 of <sref ref="[depr.conversions.string]"/> introduces <tt>byte_err_string</tt> 
as "a byte string to display on errors". What does display mean? The string is returned 
on error, it's not displayed anywhere.
<p/>
Paragraph 14 says "Otherwise, if the object was constructed with a
byte-error string, the member function shall return the byte-error
string." The term byte-error string is not used anywhere else.
<p/>
Paragraph 17 talks about storing "default values in <tt>byte_err_string</tt>".
What default value? Is "Hello, world!" allowed? If it means
default-construction it should say so. If paragraph 14 says it won't
be used what does it matter how it's initialized? The end of the
paragraph refers to storing "<tt>byte_err</tt> in <tt>byte_err_string</tt>". This should
be more clearly related to the wording in paragraph 14.
<p/>
It might help if the constructor (and destructor) was specified before
the other member functions, so it can more formally define the
difference between being "constructed with a byte-error string" and
not.
<p/>
All the same issues apply to the <tt>wide_err_string</tt> member.
