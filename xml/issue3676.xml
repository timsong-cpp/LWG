the <i>Remarks</i> say:

The resulting locale has a name if and only if the first two arguments have names.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The case where <tt>cats</tt> is <tt>locale::none</tt> seems very similar to the issue that 
LWG <iref ref="2295"/> reports with the case where the provided facet pointer is <tt>nullptr</tt>.
That is, if no composition is actually occurring, then using the name of <tt>other</tt> 
seems to be reasonable.
<p/>
It would help consistency if both cases are treated the same way.
<p/>
Note: The <tt>locale::all</tt> case should not imply using the name of <tt>one</tt>. 
<tt>locale::all</tt> does not necessarily cover all of the C locale categories on a platform.
