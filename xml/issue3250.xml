We have:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"For floating-point numbers, the alternate form causes the result of the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So does that mean that infinity is formatted as <tt>"inf."</tt> and NaN as <tt>"nan."</tt>? (Or 
something like that? Where exactly do we add the decimal point in this case?) Or does this 
affect infinity but not NaN (because we can handwave that a NaN value is not a 
"floating-point number")?
<p/>
I suspect that this should only cover finite floating-point numbers.

Right. So infinity and NaN should be still formatted as <tt>"inf"</tt> and <tt>"nan"</tt> 
without a decimal point.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4830">N4830</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[format.string.std]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-6- [&hellip;] For floating-point types, the alternate form causes the result of the conversion 
<ins>of finite values</ins> to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow 
it. Normally, a decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit 
follows it. In addition, for <tt>g</tt> and <tt>G</tt> conversions, trailing zeros are not removed 
from the result.
