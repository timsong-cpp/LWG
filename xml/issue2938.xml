<p>
Force the literal type requirement for the <tt>const_iterator</tt> in the
<tt>std::basic_string_view</tt> so that iterators of <tt>std::basic_string_view</tt>
could be used in <tt>constexpr</tt> functions.

<p>
I don't believe the blanket "all operations" wording is quite correct.
<p/>
First, <tt>T t;</tt> (required by <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>) isn't usable in a constant expression if the iterator is a 
pointer, since it would leave it uninitialized. 
<p/>
Second, an explicit destructor call <tt>u.~T()</tt> (required by <tt>Destructible</tt>) isn't usable if the iterator is a 
class type because it explicitly invokes a non-<tt>constexpr</tt> function (the destructor); see [expr.const]/2.2.

<p>Set priority to 2. Lisa and Alisdair to work with Antony to come up with better wording. The same wording can be used for <iref ref="2897"/>.</p>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4640">N4640</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add to the end of the <sref ref="[string.view.template]"/> section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- In every specialization <tt>basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt;</tt>, the type traits shall satisfy the character
traits requirements (21.2), and the type <tt>traits::char_type</tt> shall name the same type as <tt>charT</tt>.
<p/>
<ins>-?- All operations on <tt>iterator</tt> and <tt>const_iterator</tt> that are required to satisfy the 
random access iterator requirements are usable in constant expressions.</ins>
</p>
</blockquote>
