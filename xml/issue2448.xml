<title>Non-normative Container destructor specification</title>

<p>
According to Table 96 &mdash; "Container requirements" the specification:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
note: the destructor is applied to every element of <tt>a</tt>; any
memory obtained is deallocated.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The initial "note:" can be read as if that part of the specification would not be normative (This note form
differs from footnotes in tables, which have normative meaning).
<p/>
It seems that this initial part of the specification exists since C++98. But comparing with
the similar <a href="https://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Container.html">SGI Container specification</a> there is no evidence
for that being intended to be non-normative.

NJ: If we fix this, we should also fix it elsewhere. Oh, this is the only place?<br/> 
GR: If this is intended to be different from elsewhere, we should make sure.<br/> 
AM: <tt>valarray</tt> specifies this without the "note:".<br/> 
DK: <tt>valarray</tt> requires trivially destructible types!<br/> 
GR: That's good enough for me.<br/> 
NJ: First time <tt>valarray</tt> has been useful for something!
