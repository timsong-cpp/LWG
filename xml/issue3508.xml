<tt>atomic_ref&lt;T&gt;</tt> requires only that its template parameter <tt>T</tt> is trivially copyable,
which is not sufficient to implement many of the class template's member functions. Consider, for example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
int main() {
  static const int x = 42;
  std::atomic_ref&lt;const int&gt; meow{x};
  meow.store(0);
  return meow.load();
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Since <tt>const int</tt> is trivially copyable, this is a well-formed C++20 program that returns <tt>0</tt>.
That said, the <tt>store</tt> call that mutates the value of a constant object is (a) not implementable with
library technology, and (b) pure madness that violates the language semantics. <tt>atomic_ref::store</tt>
should presumably require <tt>is_copy_assignable_v&lt;T&gt;</tt>, and other operations need to have their
requirements audited as well. (Related: LWG <iref ref="3012"/> made similar changes to <tt>atomic</tt>.)
<p/>
As a related issue, <tt>volatile atomic&lt;T&gt;</tt> recently had its member functions deprecated when they
are not lock-free. Presumably <tt>atomic_ref&lt;volatile T&gt;</tt> should require that atomic operations on
<tt>T</tt> be lock-free for consistency.
<p/>

<p/>
The last point is related to LWG <iref ref="3417"/> (another case where we screwed up the <tt>volatile</tt>
deprecations).
