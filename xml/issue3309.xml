<p>
It is unclear whether the streams headers implicitly <tt>#include &lt;ios&gt;</tt> and make (for example) 
the name <tt>std::basic_ios</tt> available after including <tt>&lt;sstream&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
This question becomes more important as header units arrive with modules, where there is an explicit 
choice whether to re-export names from subordinate headers.
