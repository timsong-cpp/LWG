Example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
// Input UTF-16 string is incomplete - only first half of
// UTF-16 surrogate pair L"\xD843\xDEF9":
wchar_t in_utf16[] = L"\xD843";

std::wstring_convert&lt;std::codecvt_utf8_utf16&lt;wchar_t&gt;&gt; cvt;
auto out_utf8 = cvt.to_bytes(in_utf16); // No error.
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
There is no indication that input was incomplete (the value returned
by <tt>cvt.state()</tt> is not documented and so cannot be examined by user for
that purpose). As such the user will not know that more input data
should be provided in additional call to <tt>cvt.to_bytes()</tt>.
<p/>
The output can be incomplete too: MSVC2017 implementation (which as
far as I can tell is standard conforming) produces <tt>"\xF0"</tt> in <tt>out_utf8</tt>.
Again, no indication of incomplete output produced is provided by
<tt>std::wstring_convert</tt>.
<p/>
IMO it makes <tt>std::wstring_convert</tt> in its current state completely
useless (it cannot be relied upon to either produce complete and valid
UTF sequence or throw an error in all situations).
<p/>
Imagine a file has UTF16 encoded text. You want to read all the data
from a file at once and convert it into UTF8 using
<tt>std::wstring_convert&lt;std::codecvt_utf8_utf16&lt;wchar_t&gt;&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
Now, if a file contains completely <em>invalid</em> UTF16 (for example,
forbidden or incorrectly encoded Unicode code points) you will get an
exception from <tt>std::wstring_convert&lt;std::codecvt_utf8_utf16&lt;wchar_t&gt;&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
But if a file contains <em>incomplete</em> (but in all other regards <em>valid</em>)
UTF16 (for ex. file ends with only the first half of a valid surrogate
pair) you will <em>neither</em> get an error exception from
<tt>std::wstring_convert&lt;std::codecvt_utf8_utf16&lt;wchar_t&gt;&gt;</tt> <em>nor</em> any
indication that the input provided to 
<tt>std::wstring_convert&lt;std::codecvt_utf8_utf16&lt;wchar_t&gt;&gt;</tt> was incomplete.

<p>Priority 3; send to LEWG</p>

<note>2017-02 in Kona, LEWG recommends NAD</note>

<note>2017-06-02 Issues Telecon</note>
<p>This facility has a number of known problems, including poor error handling.
The feature has been deprecated, and the plan is to replace it with better
facilities with a better API.</p>
<p>Resolve as NAD</p>
