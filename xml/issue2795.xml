<b>Addresses GB 39</b>
<p/>
The example is supposed to highlight the 'otherwise specified' 
aspect of invoking ADL, yet there is no such specification. It is 
unlikely that we intend to explicitly qualify calls to operator functions, 
so they probably should be exempted from this restriction.
<p/>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Fix example (and referenced clause) to specify use of ADL, or exempt operators from 
this clause, and find a better example, probably using <tt>swap</tt>.
</p>

<note>2016-11-09, Jonathan comments and provides wording</note>
<p>
The current wording was added by DR <iref ref="225"/>.

<note>2016-11-10, Tim Song comments</note>
<p>
The "non-operator" seems to have been added at the wrong spot. The problem at issue is permission 
to call operator functions found via ADL, not permission for operator functions in the standard 
library to ADL all over the place. The problem is not unique to operator functions in the standard 
library &mdash; a significant portion of <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;numeric&gt;</tt> 
uses some operator (<tt>==</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>+</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, etc.) that may be picked 
up via ADL.
<p/>
There is also an existing problem in that the example makes no sense anyway: the constraint in this 
paragraph only applies to non-members, yet <tt>ostream_iterator::operator=</tt> is a member function.
</p>

<note>2016-11-10, Tim Song and Jonathan agree on new wording</note>
<p>
The new wording still doesn't quite get it right:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"calls to non-operator, non-member functions in the standard library do not use functions from another namespace 
which are found through argument-dependent name lookup" can be interpreted as saying that if a user writes 
"<tt>std::equal(a, b, c, d)</tt>", that call will not use ADL'd "<tt>operator==</tt>" because 
"<tt>std::equal(a, b, c, d)</tt>" is a "call" to a "non-operator, non-member function in the standard library".
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The key point here is that "in the standard library" should be modifying "calls", not "function".
</p>
