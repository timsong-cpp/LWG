Given the following code,
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

std::stringbuf buf;
std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt; begin(&amp;buf);
std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt; end;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
it is not clear from the wording of the Standard whether <tt>begin.equal(end)</tt>
must be true. In at least one implementation it is not (CC: Sun C++ 5.10 SunOS_sparc Patch 128228-25 2013/02/20) and in at least
one implementation it is (gcc version 4.3.2 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu).
<p/>
<sref ref="[istreambuf.iterator]"/> says that <tt>end</tt> is an end-of-stream iterator since it was default
constructed. It also says that an iterator becomes equal to an end-of-stream
iterator when end of stream is reached by <tt>sgetc()</tt> having returned <tt>eof()</tt>.
<sref ref="[istreambuf.iterator::equal]"/> says that <tt>equal()</tt> returns true iff both iterators are end of stream
or not end of stream. But there seems to be no requirement that <tt>equal</tt> check for end-of-stream by calling <tt>sgetc()</tt>. 
<p/>
Jiahan Zi at BloombergLP discovered this issue through his code failing to
work correctly. Dietmar K&uuml;hl has opined in a private communication that
the iterators should compare equal.

<p>
I agree that they should compare equal, but that's in conflict with the
resolution of LWG <iref ref="2544"/>, which says that <code>begin</code>
must not be at end-of-stream because <code>&amp;buf</code> is not null.
