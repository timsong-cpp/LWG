<p>
The usual pattern now used for identifying where bitmask elements are declared, namely, as variables, preclude 
declaring them as enumerators.
<p/>
Compare: <tt>ctype_base::space</tt> in C++03 subclause 22.2.1 [lib.category.ctype] versus the same in N4582 
subclause 22.4.1 [category.ctype].
<p/>
It is unclear whether this is intentional. Further it is unclear if odr-use of bitmask elements is intended to be allowed.

<p>
Jonathan believes that this was intentional, and was done by N3110. 
Jonathan will provide more precise references.
