<p>
<paper num="P0896R4"/> changed the term of art "sorted with respect to comparator" defined in 
<sref ref="[alg.sorting.general]"/> paragraph 5 to "sorted with respect to comparator and projection." 
That proposal updated the algorithm specifications consistently. However, there were uses of the old 
term outside of <sref ref="[algorithms]"/> that are now without meaning. We should bring back the term 
"sorted with respect to comparator" to fix that lack.

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[alg.sorting.general]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-5- A sequence is <i>sorted with respect to a <tt>comp</tt> and <tt>proj</tt></i> for a comparator and projection 
<tt>comp</tt> and <tt>proj</tt> if for every iterator <tt>i</tt> pointing to the sequence and every non-negative 
integer <tt>n</tt> such that <tt>i + n</tt> is a valid iterator pointing to an element of the sequence,
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
bool(invoke(comp, invoke(proj, *(i + n)), invoke(proj, *i)))
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
is <tt>false</tt>.
<p/>
<ins>-?- A sequence is <i>sorted with respect to a comparator <tt>comp</tt></i> for a comparator <tt>comp</tt> 
if it is sorted with respect to <tt>comp</tt> and <tt>identity{}</tt> (the identity projection).</ins>
