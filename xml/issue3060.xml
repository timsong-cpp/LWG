<p>
All of the scan algorithms ([exclusive.scan], [inclusive.scan], [transform.exclusive.scan], [transform.inclusive.scan]) have language like "If <tt>init</tt> is provided, <tt>T</tt> shall be 
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt> (Table 23); otherwise, <tt>ForwardIterator1</tt>'s value type shall be
<tt>MoveConstructible</tt>.". However, the algorithms operational semantics require that that type 
be written "by copy" to the destination range, making support for move only types impossible.
<p/>
We probably need to examine real implementations of these things and see what requirements are actually 
necessary, as in general <tt><i>GENERALIZED_SUM</i></tt> and <tt><i>GENERALIZED_NONCOMMUTATIVE_SUM</i></tt> 
need to specify the type used to store intermediate calculations.
