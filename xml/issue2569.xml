<title><tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt> requirements are too strict</title>

<p>
<sref ref="[meta.logical]"/>/2 and /5 impose the following requirement on the arguments of <tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every template type argument shall be usable as a base class and shall have a static data member value which is convertible to 
<tt>bool</tt>, is not hidden, and is unambiguously available in the type.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Since the requirement is unconditional, it applies even to type arguments whose instantiation is not required due to short circuiting. 
This seems contrary to the design intent, expressed in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0013r1.html">P0013R1</a>, 
that it is valid to write <tt>conjunction_v&lt;is_class&lt;T&gt;, is_foo&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt> even if instantiating 
<tt>is_foo&lt;T&gt;::value</tt> is ill-formed for non-class types.

<p>Ville provided wording for both <iref ref="2569"/> and <iref ref="2570"/>.</p>
<p>Tuesday AM: Move to Tentatively Ready</p>

<note>2016-11-15, Reopen upon request of Dawn Perchik </note>
<p>
The proposed wording requires an update, because the referenced issue LWG <iref ref="2568"/> is still open.

<resolution>
<note>We recommend applying the proposed resolution for LWG issues 2567 and 2568 before this
proposed resolution, lest the poor editor gets confused.</note>

<p>In [meta.logical],</p>

<p>- insert a new paragraph before paragraph 2:</p>

<p><ins>The class template <tt>conjunction</tt> forms the logical conjunction of its
template type arguments.</ins></p>

<p>- move paragraph 4 before paragraph 2, and edit
paragraph 2 as follows:</p>

<p><del>The class template <tt>conjunction</tt> forms the logical conjunction of its
template type arguments.</del>
Every template type argument <ins>for which <tt>Bi::value</tt> is instantiated</ins>
shall be usable as a base class and shall have a member value which is
convertible to <tt>bool</tt>, is not hidden, and is unambiguously available in the type.</p>

<p>- insert a new paragraph before paragraph 5:</p>

<p><ins>The class template <tt>disjunction</tt> forms the logical disjunction
of its template type arguments.</ins></p>

<p>- move paragraph 7 before paragraph 5, and edit
paragraph 5 as follows:</p>

<p><del>The class template <tt>disjunction</tt> forms the logical disjunction
of its template type arguments.</del>
Every template type argument <ins>for which <tt>Bi::value</tt> is instantiated</ins>
shall be usable as a base class and shall have a member value which is
convertible to <tt>bool</tt>, is not hidden, and is unambiguously available in the type.</p>
