<p>
The <code>formatter&lt;chrono::duration&lt;Rep, Period&gt;, charT&gt;</code>
partial specialization needs to be able to format the `Rep` type, because
the `%Q` conversion specifier says to format the value returned by `.count()`
which is of type `Rep`. This implies that the `Rep` type must be formattable,
although the precise method of formatting it is not specified. Presumably
either <code>format("{}", d.count())</code> or
<code>ostrm &lt;&lt; d.count()</code> needs to work.
</p>

<p>
<sref ref="[format.formatter.spec]"/> p2 (2.3) says:
<blockquote>
For each `charT`, for each cv-unqualified arithmetic type `ArithmeticT`
other than `char`, `wchar_t`, `char8_t`, `char16_t`, or `char32_t`,
a specialization:
<code>template&lt;&gt; struct formatter&lt;ArithmeticT, charT&gt;;</code>
</blockquote>
However, nothing prevents the excluded types being used as the `rep` for a
`chrono::duration`.
This means you can use <code>chrono::duration&lt;wchar_t&gt;</code> and
<code>chrono::duration&lt;char8_t&gt;</code> as durations,
but you can't format them to `char` strings.
</p>

<p>
I think only the `%Q` conversion specifier formats the `rep` type directly
(without converting durations to formattable types like `hours` or `seconds`),
and so I don't think this problem exists for other chrono `formatter`
specializations, because `%Q` can only be used for durations
(that's not <i>entirely</i> clear, since `%q` and `%Q` are specified to format
"the duration's unit suffix" and "the duration's numeric value",
but presumably that means they can only be used for `duration` types).
</p>

<p>
Should the specialization of `formatter` for `chrono::duration` be constrained
to require that the `rep` type can be formatted?
Or should the `%Q` conversion specifier say that the numeric value is
formatted by inserting into an `ostream` (which would treat `wchar_t` and
`char8_t` rep types as characters, not integers)?
Or should `%Q` say that the numeric value is converted to an integral type,
which we know how to format?
</p>

<p>
This is somewhat related to issue <iref ref="953"/>, since it's unclear
which operations "a class emulating an arithmetic type" needs to support.
