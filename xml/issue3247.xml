<p>
The specification of the <tt>ranges::iter_move</tt> customization point in [iterator.cust.move] 
doesn't include a deleted poison pill overload. There is no <tt>std::iter_move</tt> to avoid, 
so such a poison pill is not needed. This is fine, except that it suggests that unqualified 
lookup for <tt>iter_move</tt> in the <tt>iter_move(E)</tt> expression in paragraph 1.1 should 
find declarations of iter_move in the global namespace via normal unqualified lookup, when the 
design intent is that only ADL be used to find overloads of <tt>iter_move</tt>.
<p/>
Absent a more idiomatic wording to specify an ADL-only lookup, we can correct the problem by 
specifying the lookup in paragraph 1.1 is performed in a context that includes the declaration 
"<tt>void iter_move();</tt>" which has the desired effect.
