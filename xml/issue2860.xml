<title><tt>launder</tt> and base class subobjects</title>

<p>
There is an apparent oversight in the wording for <tt>launder</tt> that allows it to return base class 
subobjects which differ in their polymorphic behaviour between calls to <tt>launder</tt>.
</p>
<p>
This can be fixed by restricting <tt>launder</tt> from returning pointers to base class subobjects:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>always, or</p></li>
<li><p>only for polymorphic class types.</p></li>
</ol>

<note>2017-03-04, Kona</note>
<p>Set priority to 2. This was discussed in EWG (via a paper). Assign this (and <iref ref="2859"/>) to Core.</p>

<note>2017-08-14, CWG telecon note</note>
<p>
Core recommends NAD after discussion in EWG.
