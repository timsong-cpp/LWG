N4296 <sref ref="[alg.sorting]"/>/3 reads:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
For all algorithms that take <tt>Compare</tt>, there is a version that uses <tt>operator&lt;</tt> instead. That is, 
<tt>comp(*i,*j) != false</tt> defaults to <tt>*i &lt; *j != false</tt>. For algorithms other than those described in 
25.4.3  to work correctly, <tt>comp</tt>  has to induce a strict weak ordering on the values.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So it's not specified clearly what happens if <tt>comp</tt> or <tt>operator&lt;</tt> don't induce a strict weak ordering. 
Is it undefined or implementation-defined behavior? It seems that it should be stated more clearly that the behavior is 
undefined.

<p>This wording is relative to N4431.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[alg.sorting]"/>/3 to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

*j) != false</tt> defaults to <tt>*i &lt; *j != false</tt>. For algorithms other than those described in 25.4.3 <del>to work
correctly</del>, <tt>comp</tt> <ins>shall</ins><del>has to</del> induce a strict weak ordering on the values.
