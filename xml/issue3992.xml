<p>
Recent discussions on <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/64644">llvm-64644</a>
came to the conclusion that <tt>basic_stringbuf() &amp;&amp;</tt> introduced by <paper num="P0408"/>
might just copy the underlying buffer into a string object and not actually move the allocated space. 
While the wording tried to encourage that, especially with the postcondition that the buffer must 
be empty afterwards, it failed to specify that the move is never a copy.
<p/>
I suggest to amend the specification to enforce implementors to do the <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt> thing. 
There might be ABI issues for those who still copy.
<p/>
Some investigation into <sref ref="[container.reqmts]"/> p.16 and <sref ref="[basic.string.general]"/> 
shows that a <tt>basic_string</tt> as a standard container should move with <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt>.
<p/>
Unfortunately, we cannot say
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<ins><tt>str().data() == buf.data()</tt> before calling <tt>str()</tt></ins>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
as a postcondition due to SSO. Maybe a note could be added to eliminate the confusion.
</p>

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4958"/>.
</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[stringbuf.members]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
basic_string&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt; str() &amp;&amp;;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-9- <i>Postconditions</i>: The underlying character sequence <tt>buf</tt> is empty and <tt>pbase()</tt>, <tt>pptr()</tt>, 
<tt>epptr()</tt>, <tt>eback()</tt>, <tt>gptr()</tt>, and <tt>egptr()</tt> are initialized as if by calling 
<tt>init_buf_ptrs()</tt> with an empty <tt>buf</tt>.
<p/>
-10- <i>Returns</i>: A <tt>basic_string&lt;charT, traits, Allocator&gt;</tt> object move constructed from the 
<tt>basic_stringbuf</tt>'s underlying character sequence in <tt>buf</tt>. This can be achieved by first adjusting <tt>buf</tt> 
to have the same content as <tt>view()</tt>.
<p/>
<ins>[<i>Note:</i> &mdash; <sref ref="[container.reqmts]"/> require the move construction of the return
value to be <tt>&#x1d4aa;(1)</tt> <i>end note</i>]</ins>
</p>
