<title>Some type-completeness constraints of traits are overspecified</title>

LWG <iref ref="2797"/> (RU 2) suggests that certain type-traits should be required to
diagnose violations of their pre-conditions. The basic idea is founded and I see no problems for
requiring this for the mentioned traits <tt>alignment_of</tt> or <tt>is_base_of</tt>,
for example. But if we want to require this diagnostics for some other traits, such as <tt>is_convertible</tt>,
<tt>is_constructible</tt> (and friends), or <tt>is_callable</tt> (and possibly some others), we really should
be sure that our current requirements are OK. 
<p/>
Unfortunately, there exists some cases, where we currently overspecify imposing complete type requirements where they
are not actually required. For example, for the following situation the answer of the trait could 
be given without ever needing the complete type of <tt>X</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct X; // Never defined

static_assert(std::is_convertible_v&lt;X, const X&amp;&gt;);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately we cannot <em>always</em> allow incomplete types, because most type constructions or conversions indeed
require a complete type, so <em>generally</em> relaxing the current restrictions is also not an option.
<p/>
The core language has a solution for this "small" gap of situations, where the response of the compiler <em>might</em>
depend on type completeness: Undefined behaviour. So, I believe we need a somewhat more detailled form to express the
intend here. Informally, I would suggest that the program should only be ill-formed in the situation described by 
LWG <iref ref="2797"/>, if there exists the <em>possibility</em> that the compiler would require complete types for the
considered operation. The example shown above, <tt>std::is_convertible_v&lt;X, const X&amp;&gt;</tt>, would <b>never</b>
require the need to complete <tt>X</tt>, so here no violation should exist.
<p/>
The presented example might seem a tiny one, but the Standard Library type traits are extreme fundamental tools and we should
try to not give the impression that an approximate rule of the current type constraints breaks reasonable code.
<p/>
It is correct, that above example has currently undefined behaviour due to the breakage of pre-conditions, therefore
this issue suggests to fix the current situation <em>before</em> enforcing a diagnostic for such valid situations.

<p>Set priority to 2. Is related to <iref ref="2797"/>, but really needs an audit of the type traits.</p>

<p>Issues <iref ref="2797"/>, <iref ref="2939"/>, <iref ref="3022"/>, and <iref ref="3099"/> are all closely related. Walter to write a paper resolving them.</p>
