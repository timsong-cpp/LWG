[contents]/3 says
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Whenever a name <tt>x</tt> defined in the standard library is mentioned, the name <tt>x</tt> is assumed to be fully 
qualified as <tt>::std::x</tt>, unless explicitly described otherwise. For example, if the <i>Effects</i> section 
for library function <tt>F</tt> is described as calling library function <tt>G</tt>, the function <tt>::std::G</tt> is meant.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
With the introduction of nested namespaces inside <tt>std</tt>, this rule needs tweaking. For instance, 
<tt>time_point_cast</tt>'s <i>Returns</i> clause says "<tt>time_point&lt;Clock, 
ToDuration&gt;(duration_cast&lt;ToDuration&gt;(t.time_since_epoch()))</tt>"; that reference to <tt>duration_cast</tt> 
obviously means <tt>::std::chrono::duration_cast</tt>, not <tt>::std::duration_cast</tt>, which doesn't exist.

<p>Priority 2; Jonathan to provide wording</p>

<note>2019 Cologne Wednesday night</note>
<p>Geoffrey suggested editing <sref ref="[contents]"/>/2 to mention the case when we're defining things in a sub-namespace.</p>
<p>Jonathan to word this.</p>

<note>2020-10-02; Issue processing telecon: new wording from Jens</note>

<note>2020-11-04; Jens provides improved wording</note>

<note>2020-11-06; Reflector discussion</note>
<p>
Casey suggests to insert "or Annex D" after "in clauses 16-32". This insertion has been performed during
reflector discussions immediately because it seemed editorial.
</p>

<note>2020-11-15; Reflector poll</note>
<p>
Set priority status to Tentatively Ready after seven votes in favour during reflector discussions.
