<sref ref="[time.format]"/>/3:
<blockquote>
If the formatted object does not contain the information the conversion
specifier refers to, an exception of type <tt>format_error</tt> is thrown.
</blockquote>

<sref ref="[time.format]"/>/6:
<blockquote>
If the type being formatted does not contain the information that the format
flag needs, an exception of type <tt>format_error</tt> is thrown.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
It's unclear how to determine if a type contain the needed information,
and implementations diverge.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;format&gt;

auto f(std::chrono::month_day_last mdl) {
  return std::format("{:%j}", mdl);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both libstdc++ and libc++ produce a compile-time error, claiming that the
argument does not contain the information, while MSVC STL throws
<tt>format_error</tt> at run time unless <tt>mdl</tt> is `January/last`,
in which case the function returns "031".
</p>
<p>
Another interesting case is <code>format("{:%d}", mdl)</code> where the value
can be printed for all months <i>except</i> February, which requires a year
to know how many days it has.
</p>

<p>
A related example from Jonathan Wakely:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::chrono::weekday_indexed wdi(Monday, 7);  // 7th Monday in the month
assert( ! wdi.ok() );
assert( wdi.weekday().ok() );
std::format("{:%a}", wdi);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
For <tt>%a</tt> the required information is "a valid weekday",
and arguably this does contain a valid weekday.
On the other hand, there's no 7th Monday, so this isn't valid.
Should this throw or not?
</p>
<p>
This was discussed by LWG and Howard Hinnant summarized the intended behaviour as:
<blockquote>
"The intention of <sref ref="[time.format]"/>/6 is to address things like
formatting a <tt>duration</tt> with <tt>%F</tt>. A <tt>duration</tt> doesn't contain
the calendrical information that <tt>%F</tt> requires (year, month, day).
Ditto for using <tt>%a</tt> (weekday name) with a <tt>year</tt>.
It is meant to address mismatching <i>types</i> and flags,
and not meant to address <i>values</i>."
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The type <tt>chrono::weekday</tt> does contain the information needed to print
a weekday. A specific invalid value doesn't change that.
The type <tt>chrono::month_day_last</tt> does not contain the information
needed to print the day of the year.
A specific value where the day can be known doesn't change that.
The day of month is more interesting, and might need more discussion.
</p>
<p>
Jonathan proposed adding more examples to clarify the intention that only the
type matters, and not the value. There is some redundancy between p3 and p6.
Referring to "the formatted object" in p3 seems unclear.
Saying "type" as in p6 is better.
But p6 refers to "format flag" which is not defined,
whereas p3 uses "conversion specifier" (defined at the start of that paragraph).
The two uses of "flag" in p6 look like remnants from the earlier <tt>chrono::format</tt> 
feature that was replaced by integration with <tt>std::format</tt>.
