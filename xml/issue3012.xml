<sref ref="[atomics.types.generic]" /> requires that <tt>T</tt> for <tt>std::atomic</tt> is trivially copyable. 
Unfortunately, that's not sufficient to implement <tt>atomic</tt>. Consider <tt>atomic&lt;T&gt;::load</tt>, which 
wants to look something like this:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T&gt;
struct atomic {
  __compiler_magic_storage_for_t storage;

  T load(memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst) const {
    return __magic_intrinsic(storage);
  }

};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Forming this return statement, though, requires that <tt>T</tt> is copy constructible &mdash; trivially copyable things 
aren't necessarily copyable! For example, the following is trivially copyable but breaks libc++, libstdc++, and msvc++:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct NonAssignable {
  int i;
  NonAssignable() = delete;
  NonAssignable(int) : i(0) {}
  NonAssignable(const NonAssignable&amp;) = delete;
  NonAssignable(NonAssignable&amp;&amp;) = default;
  NonAssignable&amp; operator=(const NonAssignable&amp;) = delete;
  NonAssignable&amp; operator=(NonAssignable&amp;&amp;) = delete;
  ~NonAssignable() = default;
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
All three standard libraries are happy as long as <tt>T</tt> is trivially copy constructible, assignability is not required. 
Casey Carter says that we might want to still require trivially copy assignable though, since what happens when you do an 
<tt>atomic&lt;T&gt;::store</tt> is morally an "assignment" even if it doesn't use the user's assignment operator.

<p>Status to Open; Casey and STL to work with Billy for better wording.</p>
<p>Should this include trivially copyable as well as trivially copy assignable?</p>
