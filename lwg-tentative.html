<p>
In an <tt>emplace</tt> member function the function parameter pack may be bound
to a priori unlimited number of objects: some or all of them can be
elements of the container itself. Apparently, in order to conform to the
blanket statement 23.2 [container.requirements]/11, the
implementation must check all of them for that possibility. A possible
solution can involve extending the exception in 23.2 [container.requirements]/12 also to the emplace member. As a
side note, the <tt>push_back</tt> and <tt>push_front</tt> member
functions are luckily not affected by this problem, can be efficiently
implemented anyway.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Splice is a very useful feature of <tt>list</tt>. This functionality is also very
useful for any other node based container, and I frequently wish it were
available for maps and sets. It seems like an omission that these
containers lack this capability. Although the complexity for a splice is
the same as for an insert, the actual time can be much less since the
objects need not be reallocated and copied. When the element objects are
heavy and the compare operations are fast (say a <tt>map&lt;int, huge_thingy&gt;</tt>)
this can be a big win.
</p>

<p>
<b>Suggested resolution:</b>
</p>

<p>
Add the following signatures to map, set, multimap, multiset, and the unordered associative containers:
</p>
<blockquote><pre> 
void splice(list&lt;T,Allocator&gt;&amp;&amp; x);
void splice(list&lt;T,Allocator&gt;&amp;&amp; x, const_iterator i);
void splice(list&lt;T,Allocator&gt;&amp;&amp; x, const_iterator first, const_iterator last);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Hint versions of these are also useful to the extent hint is useful.
(I'm looking for guidance about whether hints are in fact useful.)
</p>
 
<blockquote><pre> 
void splice(const_iterator position, list&lt;T,Allocator&gt;&amp;&amp; x);
void splice(const_iterator position, list&lt;T,Allocator&gt;&amp;&amp; x, const_iterator i);
void splice(const_iterator position, list&lt;T,Allocator&gt;&amp;&amp; x, const_iterator first, const_iterator last);
</pre></blockquote>

]</i></p>


<blockquote>
<p>
I'm not disagreeing with the NAD Future resolution.  But when the future gets
here, here is a possibility worth exploring:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Add to the "unique" associative containers:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
typedef <i>details</i>      node_ptr;

node_ptr             remove(const_iterator p);
pair&lt;iterator, bool&gt; insert(node_ptr&amp;&amp; nd);
iterator             insert(const_iterator p, node_ptr&amp;&amp; nd);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
And add to the "multi" associative containers:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
typedef <i>details</i> node_ptr;

node_ptr remove(const_iterator p);
iterator insert(node_ptr&amp;&amp; nd);
iterator insert(const_iterator p, node_ptr&amp;&amp; nd);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<tt>Container::node_ptr</tt> is a smart pointer much like <tt>unique_ptr</tt>.
It owns a node obtained from the container it was removed from.  It maintains a
reference to the allocator in the container so that it can properly deallocate
the node if asked to, even if the allocator is stateful.  This being said, the
<tt>node_ptr</tt> can not outlive the container for this reason.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>node_ptr</tt> offers "<tt>const</tt>-free" access to the node's
<tt>value_type</tt>.
</p>

<p>
With this interface, clients have a great deal of flexibility:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A client can remove a node from one container, and insert it into another
(without any heap allocation).  This is the splice functionality this issue
asks for.
</li>
<li>
A client can remove a node from a container, change its key or value, and insert
it back into the same container, or another container, all without the cost of
allocating a node.
</li>
<li>
If the Compare function is nothrow (which is very common), then this functionality
is nothrow unless modifying the value throws.  And if this does throw, it does
so outside of the containers involved.
</li>
<li>
If the Compare function does throw, the <tt>insert</tt> function will have the
argument <tt>nd</tt> retain ownership of the node.
</li>
<li>
The <tt>node_ptr</tt> should be independent of the <tt>Compare</tt> parameter
so that a node can be transferred from <tt>set&lt;T, C1, A&gt;</tt>
to <tt>set&lt;T, C2, A&gt;</tt> (for example).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is how the customer might use this functionality:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Splice a node from one container to another:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
m2.insert(m1.remove(i));
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Change the "key" in a <tt>std::map</tt> without the cost of node reallocation:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto p = m.remove(i);
p->first = new_key;
m.insert(std::move(p));
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Change the "value" in a <tt>std::set</tt> without the cost of node reallocation:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto p = s.remove(i);
*p = new_value;
s.insert(std::move(p));
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Move a move-only or heavy object out of an associative container (as opposed to
the proposal in <a href="lwg-active.html#1041">1041</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
MoveOnly x = std::move(*s.remove(i));
</pre></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<tt>remove(i)</tt> transfers ownership of the node from the set to a temporary
<tt>node_ptr</tt>.
</li>
<li>
The <tt>node_ptr</tt> is dereferenced, and that non-const reference is sent to
<tt>move</tt> to cast it to an rvalue.
</li>
<li>
The rvalue <tt>MoveOnly</tt> is move constructed into <tt>x</tt> from
the <tt>node_ptr</tt>.
</li>
<li>
<tt>~node_ptr()</tt> destructs the moved-from <tt>MoveOnly</tt> and deallocates
the node.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Contrast this with the <a href="lwg-active.html#1041">1041</a> solution:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
MoveOnly x = std::move(s.extract(i).first);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The former requires one move construction for <tt>x</tt> while the latter
requires two (one into the <tt>pair</tt> and then one into <tt>x</tt>).  Either
of these constructions can throw (say if there is only a copy constructor for
<tt>x</tt>).  With the former, the point of throw is outside of the container
<tt>s</tt>, after the element has been removed from the container.  With the latter,
one throwing construction takes place prior to the removal of the element, and
the second takes place after the element is removed.
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
The "node insertion" API maintains the API associated with inserting <tt>value_type</tt>s
so the customer can use familiar techniques for getting an iterator to the 
inserted node, or finding out whether it was inserted or not for the "unique"
containers.
</p>

<p>
Lightly prototyped.  No implementation problems.  Appears to work great
for the client.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Howard Hinnant observed in reflector message c++std-lib-30841 that 20.14.12.2 [func.wrap.func] 
makes the member swap <tt>noexcept</tt>, even though the non-member swap is not <tt>noexcept</tt>. 
<p/>
The latter was an outcome of the discussions during the Batavia meeting and the Madrid meeting 
involving LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#1349">1349</a>, which seems to indicate that the remaining <tt>noexcept</tt> 
specifier at the member swap is incorrect and should be removed.
<p/>
But if we allow for a potentially throwing member swap of <tt>std::function</tt>, this causes 
another conflict with the exception specification for the following member function:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class F&gt; function&amp; operator=(reference_wrapper&lt;F&gt; f) <span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bolder">noexcept</span>;
</pre><blockquote><p>
<i>Effects</i>: <tt>function(f).<span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bolder">swap</span>(*this);</tt>
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
Note that in this example the sub-expression <tt>function(f)</tt> does not cause any problems,
because of the nothrow-guarantee given in 20.14.12.2.1 [func.wrap.func.con] p. 10. The problem
is located in the usage of the swap which could potentially throw given the general latitude. 
<p/>
So, either the Madrid meeting decision need to be revised (and both member and free swap of 
<tt>std::function</tt> should be noexcept), or this function needs to be adapted as well,
e.g. by taking the exception-specification away or by changing the semantics.
<p/>
One argument for "swap-may-throw" would be to allow for small-object optimization techniques
where the copy of the target may throw. But given the fact that the swap function has been guaranteed 
to be "Throws: Nothing" from TR1 on, it seems to me that that there would still be opportunities to 
perform small-object optimizations just restricted to the set of target copies that cannot throw. 
<p/>
In my opinion member swap of <tt>std::function</tt> has always been intended to be no-throw, because
otherwise there would be no good technical reason to specify the effects of several member 
functions in terms of the "construct-swap" idiom (There are three functions that are defined
this way), which provides the strong exception safety in this case. I suggest to enforce that both 
member swap and non-member swap of <tt>std::function</tt> are nothrow functions as it had been guaranteed 
since TR1 on.

<p>
Dietmar: May not be swappable in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: This is wide contact. Then we should be taking noexcept off instead of putting it on. This is preferred resolution.
</p>
<p>
Pablo: This is bigger issue. Specification of assignment in terms of swap is suspect to begin with. It is over specification.
How this was applied to string is a better example to work from.
</p>
<p>
Pablo: Two problems: inconsistency that should be fixed (neither should have noexcept), the other issues is that assignment
should not be specified in terms of swap. There are cases where assignment should succeed where swap would fail. This is easier
with string as it should follow container rules.

Dave: This is because of allocators? The allocator makes this not work.

<p>
Howard: There is a type erased allocator in shared_ptr. There is a noexcept allocator in shared_ptr.
</p>
<p>
Pablo: shared_ptr is a different case. There are shared semantics and the allocator does move around.
A function does not have shared semantics.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: Function objects think they have unique ownership.
</p>
<p>
Howard: In function we specify semantics with copy construction and swap.
</p>
<p>
<b>Action Item</b> (Pablo): Write this up better (why assignment should not be defined in terms of swap)
</p>
<p>
Howard: Not having trouble making function constructor no throw.
</p>
<p>
Dietmar: Function must allocate memory.
</p>
<p>
Howard: Does not put stuff that will throw on copy or swap in small object optimization. Put those on heap.
Storing allocator, but has to be no throw copy constructable.
</p>
<p>
Pablo: Are you allowed to or required to swap or move allocators in case or swap or move.
</p>
<p>
Dave: An allocator that is type erased should be different...
</p>
<p>
Pablo: it is
</p>
<p>
Dave: Do you need to know something about allocator types? But only at construction time.
</p>
<p>
Pablo: You could have allocators that are different types.
</p>
<p>
Dave: Swap is two ended operation.
</p>
<p>
Pablo: Opinion is that both have to say propagate on swap for them to swap.
</p>
<p>
John: It is not arbitrary. If one person says no. No is no.
</p>
<p>
Howard: Find noexcept swap to be very useful. Would like to move in that direction and bring container design along.
</p>
<p>
Dave: If you have something were allocator must not propagate you can detect that at construction time.

<p>
For cross-referencing purposes: The resolution of this issue should be
harmonized with any resolution to LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2370">2370</a>, which addresses
inappropriate <tt>noexcept</tt>s in some function constructors.
</p>

<p>We have the following choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><tt>swap()</tt> does not throw</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Discussion</i>: This definition is desirable, and allows assignment
   to be implemented with the strong exception guarantee, but it does have
   consequences: The implementation cannot use the small-object optimization
   for a function-object <tt>F</tt> unless <tt>F</tt> is <tt>NothrowMovable</tt> 
   (nothrow-swappable is unimportant because <tt>F</tt> is not swapped with another <tt>F</tt>). 
   Note that many functors written before C++11 will not have move constructors decorated
   with <tt>noexcept</tt>, so this limitation could affect a lot of code.
</p>
<p>
It is not clear what other implementation restrictions might be
   needed. Allocators are required not to throw on move or copy. Is that
   sufficient?
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt>swap()</tt> can throw</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Discussion</i>: This definition gives maximum latitude to implementation to
   use small-object optimization. However, the strong guarantee on assignment
   is difficult to achieve.  Should we consider giving up on the strong
   guarantee? How much are we willing to pessimize code for exceptions?
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>swap()</tt> will not throw if both functions have <tt>NoThrowMoveable</tt> functors</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Discussion</i>: This definition is similar to option 2, but gives slightly
  stronger guarantees.  Here, <tt>swap()</tt> can throw, but the programmer can
  theoretically prevent that from happening. This should be straight-forward
  to implement and gives the implementation a lot of latitude for
  optimization. However, because this is a dynamic decision, the program is
  not as easy to reason about. Also, the strong guarantee for assignment is
  compromized as in option 2.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2016-08-02, Ville, Billy, and Billy comment and reinstantiate the original P/R]</i></p>

<p>
We (Ville, Billy, and Billy) propose to require that <tt>function</tt>'s <tt>swap</tt> is <tt>noexcept</tt> 
in all cases.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>libstdc++ does not throw in their <tt>swap</tt>. It is not <tt>noexcept</tt> today, but the small functor 
optimization only engages for trivially copyable types.</p></li>
<li><p>msvc++ checks <tt>is_nothrow_move_constructible</tt> before engaging the small functor optimization and marks 
its <tt>swap</tt> <tt>noexcept</tt></p></li>
<li><p>libc++ marks <tt>swap</tt> <tt>noexcept</tt> (though I have not looked at its implementation)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Moreover, many of the concerns that were raised by providing this guarantee are no longer applicable now that 
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0302r1">P0302</a> has been accepted, which removes allocator support from <tt>std::function</tt>.
<p/>
Therefore we are re-proposing the original resolution above.

<p>
Another similar issue to the <tt>operator&lt;</tt> vs greater in <tt>nth_element</tt> but not as direct occurs 
in 25.5.6 [alg.heap.operations]:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- A <em>heap</em> is a particular organization of elements in a range between two random access iterators 
<tt>[a,b)</tt>. Its two key properties are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no element greater than <tt>*a</tt> in the range and
</li>
<li><tt>*a</tt> may be removed by <tt>pop_heap()</tt>, or a new element added by <tt>push_heap()</tt>, in 
O(log(<tt>N</tt>)) time.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
As noted by Richard Smith, it seems that the first bullet should read:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>*a</tt> is not less than any element in the range
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Even better the heap condition could be stated here directly, instead of leaving it unspecified, i.e.,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Each element at <tt>(a+2*i+1)</tt> and <tt>(a+2*i+2)</tt> is less than the element at <tt>(a+i)</tt>, 
if those elements exist, for <tt>i&gt;=0</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But may be that was may be intentional to allow other heap organizations?

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
On reflector message <a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=32927">c++std-lib-32927</a>, 
Matt Austern asked whether the following example should be well-defined or not
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct X : public enable_shared_from_this&lt;X&gt; { };
auto xraw = new X;
shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp1(xraw);
shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp2(xraw);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
pointing out that 20.11.2.2.1 [util.smartptr.shared.const] does not seem to allow it, since
<tt>xp1</tt> and <tt>xp2</tt> aren't allowed to share ownership, because each of them is required to have 
<tt>use_count() == 1</tt>. Despite this wording it might be reasonable (and technical possible)
to implement that request.
<p/>
On the other hand, there is the non-normative note in 20.11.2.5 [util.smartptr.enab] p11 (already part of TR1):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The <tt>shared_ptr</tt> constructors that <span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">create unique pointers</span> 
can detect the presence of an <tt>enable_shared_from_this</tt> base and assign the newly created <tt>shared_ptr</tt> 
to its <tt>__weak_this member</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Now according to the specification in 20.11.2.2.1 [util.smartptr.shared.const] p3-7:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Y&gt; explicit shared_ptr(Y* p);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
the notion of <em>creating unique pointers</em> can be read to be included by this note, because the post-condition
of this constructor is <tt>unique() == true</tt>. Evidence for this interpretation seems to be weak, though.
<p/>
Howard Hinnant presented the counter argument, that actually the following is an "anti-idiom" and it seems questionable 
to teach it to be well-defined in any case:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto xraw = new X;
shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp1(xraw);
shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp2(xraw);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
He also pointed out that the current post-conditions of the affected <tt>shared_ptr</tt> constructor
would need to be reworded.
<p/>
It needs to be decided, which direction to follow. If this idiom seems too much broken to be supported,
the note could be improved. If it should be supported, the constructors in
20.11.2.2.1 [util.smartptr.shared.const] need a careful analysis to ensure that post-conditions
are correct.
<p/>
Several library implementations currently do not support this example, instead they typically
cause a crash. Matt points out that there are currently no explicit requirements imposed on
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> objects to prevent them from owning the same underlying object without sharing the 
ownership. It might be useful to add such a requirement.

<p><i>[2013-05-09 Jonathan comments]</i></p>

<p>
The note says the newly created <tt>shared_ptr</tt> is assigned to the <tt>weak_ptr</tt> member. It doesn't 
say before doing that the <tt>shared_ptr</tt> should check if the <tt>weak_ptr</tt> is non-empty and possibly

<p>
When I write 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::cout &lt;&lt; nullptr &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I get a compilation error, "ambiguous overload for '<tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt>' in '<tt>std::cout &lt;&lt; nullptr</tt>'". 
As far as I can tell, the compiler is right to issue that error. There are inserters for <tt>const void*</tt>, 
<tt>const char*</tt>, <tt>const signed char*</tt>, and <tt>const unsigned char*</tt>, and none for 
<tt>nullptr_t</tt>, so the expression really is ambiguous.
<p/>
<em>Proposed wording</em>:
<p/>
The obvious library solution is to add a <tt>nullptr_t</tt> overload, which would be defined something like
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class C, class T&gt;
basic_ostream&lt;C, T&gt;&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(basic_ostream&lt;C, T&gt;&amp; os, nullptr_t) 
{ 
  return os &lt;&lt; (void*) nullptr; 
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
We might also consider addressing this at a core level: add a special-case language rule that addresses all 
cases where you write <tt>f(nullptr)</tt> and <tt>f</tt> is overloaded on multiple pointer types. (Perhaps 
a tiebreaker saying that <tt>void*</tt> is preferred in such cases.)
</p>

<p><i>[2016-01-18, comments from Mike and Ville collected by Walter Brown]</i></p>

<p>
<b>Mike Miller</b>: "Changing overload resolution sounds like something that should be
considered by EWG before CWG [&hellip;]"
<p/>
<b>Ville</b>: "Agreed, such a change would be Evolutionary. Personally, I think it would also be wrong, because 
I don't see how <tt>void*</tt> is the right choice to prefer in the case of code that is currently ambiguous. 
Sure, it would solve this particular library issue, but it seemingly has wider repercussions. If LWG really wants 
to, EWG can certainly discuss this issue, but I would recommend solving it on the LWG side (which doesn't mean 
that the standard necessarily needs to change, I wouldn't call it far-fetched to NAD it)."
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08 Chicago]</i></p>

<p>Zhihao recommends NAD:</p>
<p>
<tt>nullptr</tt> is printable if being treated as <tt>void*</tt>, but causes
UB if being treated as <tt>char cv*</tt>. Capturing this ambigurity
at compile time and avoid a runtime UB is a good thing.
</p>

After the additions by <a href="lwg-defects.html#2033">2033</a>, it appears clear that the intended effect includes a reallocation and 
thus the potential effect on iterators should be explicitly added to the text in order to not contradict 
23.2.1 [container.requirements.general]/11, or at the very least, explicitly state that a reallocation may 
happen.
<p/>
Taking consistency with "reserve" into consideration, I propose:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
that the current "Remarks" are made its "Effect" instead, inserting "Reallocation happens at this point if and only 
if the function effectively reduces the capacity." after the note on non-bindingness.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
adding a "Remarks" paragraph, similar to that of reserve: "Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, 
and iterators referring to the elements in the sequence."
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
BTW, while we are at it, I believe the effect on iterators should also be explicitly stated in the other instance 
a reallocation may happen: 23.3.11.5 [vector.modifiers]/1 &mdash; even if obvious, it only contradicts 
23.2.1 [container.requirements.general]/11 implicitly. 
<p/>
I propose to also insert "Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators referring to the 
elements in the sequence." at the appropriate location in its "Remarks".

<p>
The described problem also affects <tt>std::basic_string</tt> and <tt>std::deque</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[2013-03-15 Issues Teleconference]</i></p>

<p>
Moved to Review.
</p>

<p><i>[2013-04-18, Bristol]</i></p>
 

<p>Daniel extends the P/R.</p>

<p>Rationale:</p>

<p>The wording in 21.3.1.4 [string.capacity] combined with 21.3.1.1 [string.require]
seems to say the necessary things. We cannot impose all requirements as we do for <tt>vector</tt>, because
we want to allow the short-string-optimization.</p>


<p><i>[2014-02-15 post-Issaquah session]</i></p>

<p>
STL: I think that <tt>shrink_to_fit</tt> should be a no-op when called twice.
</p>
<p>
STL: Do we ever define reallocation for <tt>deque</tt>? Nope, all mentions of "reallocation" are in <tt>vector</tt>.
     We define what it means in <tt>vector::reserve()</tt>, but not for <tt>deque</tt>.
</p>
<p>
STL: Oh duh, they define reallocate in the PR. But I think we can do better here.
</p>
<p>
STL: Optimally, deque shrinking just allocates a new map of pointers, and drops empty blocks, but preserves pointers/references to elements.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair: That's like unordered containers, invalidating only iterators.
</p>
<p>
Pablo: It doesn't make sense to reduce <tt>capacity()</tt> to <tt>size()</tt>, because <tt>deque</tt> doesn't have capacity!
</p>
<p>
STL: For <tt>vector</tt>, "effectively reduces the capacity" is unnecessary, the capacity there is observable.
</p>
<p>
STL: There is a strong reason to provide an optimal shrink to fit for <tt>deque</tt>, since only the library implementer can do this.
</p>
<p>
STL: The other thing I don't like the repeated definition of reallocation for <tt>vector</tt>, we define it once and use it in a bunch of places.
     At most we can lift it up to the <tt>vector</tt> synopsis.
</p>
<p>
STL: I'll write new wording.
</p>

<p><i>[2014-10-01, STL adds discussion and provides new wording]</i></p>

<p>
Compared to the previous proposed resolution:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
I'm changing <tt>basic_string</tt>'s wording because (1) we should guarantee that capacity won't increase, (2) we should mention 
that it's linear complexity, and (3) we can provide a better invalidation guarantee than 21.3.1.1 [string.require]/5.  
(As previously noted, we already have the strong exception guarantee.) This introduces the term "reallocation" into 
<tt>basic_string</tt>, but immediately explains what it means for iterator validity. As far as I can tell, the Small String 
Optimization doesn't complicate the wording here; it's a reason why an implementation might not honor the request, but if 
the capacity is reduced, we are definitely reallocating buffers and will invalidate everything (including when the destination 
is the small buffer).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Between N3485 and N3936, <tt>deque</tt>'s wording was updated to avoid talking about <tt>capacity()</tt> which it doesn't have.  
Since the container's capacity is unobservable, I'm saying that invalidation is unconditional.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In <tt>vector</tt>'s wording, I'm also guaranteeing that capacity won't increase, and that iterators/etc. remain valid if the 
capacity is unchanged.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
My wording doesn't directly say that <tt>shrink_to_fit()</tt> should be a no-op when called twice in a row. (Indirectly, 
if the first call reduces <tt>capacity()</tt> to <tt>size()</tt>, the second call must preserve iterators/etc.) I considered 
rewording the complexity to say "linear if reallocation happens", but that's potentially problematic (what if we copy almost 
all <tt>N</tt> elements, then one throws and we have to unwind? There are no effects, so reallocation didn't happen, yet we 
took longer than constant time). Implementers can always do better than the stated complexity bounds.
<p/>
I chose not to modify <tt>deque</tt>'s requirements, so implementations remain free to reallocate the elements themselves.
<p/>
I didn't attempt to centralize vector's reallocation wording. That can be done editorially, if someone is sufficiently motivated.

<p>
GR: I'm concerned that <tt>shrink_to_fit</tt> may cause reallocation without changing the capacity. [&hellip;] 
It's about correctness. The statement about invalidation is useless if I cannot detect whether reallocation has happened?
<p/>
AM: It seems like the logic goes the other way round: It's the capacity change that causes reallocation, so if 
there's no capacity change, there's no reallocation. But that's not quite how I'd like to say it... maybe this, : 
"If capacity does not change, no reallocation occurs."
<p/>
GR: Where does it actually say that <tt>reserve()</tt> invalidates? AM: It should say that in the container requirements. 
VV: vector specifies in <tt>reserve</tt> that there's reallocation if and only if the capacity changes. GR: I can't find
anything in the container requirements about <tt>reserve</tt>. DK: No, it's specified for every container separately. 
GR: It isn't specified for string.
<p/>
GR: I'm noticing that the issue touches on <tt>shrink_to_fit</tt> for a bunch of containers. Anyway, I think the 
reserve issue [re string] is in scope for this issue. This change is touching on a lot of members.
<p/>
AM: Landing this change will provide clarity for what we should do with <tt>basic_string</tt>. GR: We're already asking 
for changes; we should fix string as well. AM: If one of the changes is ready before the other, I'd like to land the 
finished part first, but if both are ready for Lenexa, I'm equally happy to fix them in one go.
<p/>
DK will reword this.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
According to 18.10 [support.runtime] p2:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The contents of these headers are the same as the Standard C library headers [..], <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>, [..]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Since our base C standard is C99, which doesn't have a <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>, the reference to a non-existing 
C header is irritating (In this context <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> doesn't refer to the deprecated C++ header
<tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> described in D.4 [depr.c.headers]).
<p/>
Furthermore, it would be also important that it doesn not define a macro named <tt>alignof</tt>, which C11 also defines 
in this header. 
<p/>
Currently we only have the following guarantee as part of 18.10 [support.runtime] p7:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The header <tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt> and the header <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> shall not define a macro named 
<tt>alignas</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
It is unclear what the better strategy is: Striking the reference to <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> in
18.10 [support.runtime] p2 or upgrading to C11 as new base C standard.

<p>
I don't see anything explicitly requiring this, so a container could
immediately convert the result of <tt>get_allocator().allocate(1)</tt> to a
built-in pointer of type <tt>value_type*</tt> and only deal with the built-in
pointer until it needs to deallocate it again, but that removes most

As things currently stand, this program is illegal:

int main() {
  double d = -1.23;
  double dd = std::abs(d);
  return 0;
}

<p>
The call is ambiguous because of the various integer overloads, that's because <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> provides 
<tt>abs(int)</tt> but not <tt>abs(double)</tt>.
<p/>
This lead one commenter on Stackoverflow to state that <tt>abs</tt> is dangerous, and to recommend using <tt>fabs</tt> instead.
<p/>
In general, it makes sense to declare overloaded functions that take user-defined types in the same header as the 
definition of the user-defined types; it isn't necessary to declare all of the overloads in the same place. But 
here we're not dealing with any user-defined types; we're dealing with builtin types, which are always defined; 
all of the overloads should be defined in the same place, to avoid mysterious problems like the one in the code above.
<p/>
The standard library has six overloads for <tt>abs</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
int abs(int);  // &lt;cstdlib&gt;
long abs(long); // &lt;cstdlib&gt;
long long abs(long long); // &lt;cstdlib&gt;

float abs(float); // &lt;cmath&gt;
double abs(double); // &lt;cmath&gt;
long double abs(long double); // &lt;cmath&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
These should all be declared in both headers.

<p>
<b>Rationale</b>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is by design that these members are <tt>noexcept</tt>, and changing that now would be a substantial regression in functionality. 
These classes were designed to substitute for plain pointers as transparently as possible, so since those operations are effectively 
<tt>noexcept</tt> on plain pointers, they should be <tt>noexcept</tt> on <tt>unique_ptr</tt> and <tt>shared_ptr</tt> as well. 
This matters in practice because we expect these members to be used fairly often inside the <tt>noexcept</tt> operator, and such 
code could be broken by this change. These design considerations override our general policy against <tt>noexcept</tt> for 
narrow-contract functions.
<p/>
It is notable that N3279, which proposed this policy, did not propose striking <tt>noexcept</tt> from these operations. It's not 
clear if the omission of <tt>operator*</tt> and <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> was an oversight, or an intentional reflection of the above 
considerations. N3279 was based on N3248 by the same authors, which states that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Most applications of <tt>noexcept</tt> for <tt>unique_ptr</tt> and <tt>shared_ptr</tt> are on functions with wide contracts. 
However, there are preconditions on the atomic access functions, so these should lose the specification."

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In the following "Multiline" is the value of the ECMA-262 RegExp object's multiline property.
<p/>
In <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf">ECMA-262</a>, 
there are some definitions that relate to Multiline:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
ECMA-262 15.10.2.6:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If Multiline is true, ^ matches just after LineTerminator.
<p/>
If Multiline is false, ^ does not match just after LineTerminator.
<p/>
If Multiline is true, $ matches just before LineTerminator.
<p/>
If Multiline is false, $ does not match just before LineTerminator.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ECMA-262 15.10.4.1, 15.10.7.4:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
By default, Multiline is false.
</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, the C++11 standard says that Multiline is false. As it is false,
^ matches only the beginning of the string, and $ matches only the end
of the string.
<p/>
However, two flags are defined in 28.5.2 [re.matchflag] Table 139:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<tt>match_not_bol</tt>: the character ^ in the regular expression shall not match <tt>[first,first)</tt>.
<p/>
<tt>match_not_eol</tt>: the character "$" in the regular expression shall not match <tt>[last,last)</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As Multiline is false, the <tt>match_not_bol</tt> and the <tt>match_not_eol</tt> are
meaningless because they only make ^ and $ match none.
<p/>
In my opinion, Multiline should be true.
<p/>
FYI, Multiline of the existing implementations are as follows:
<p/>
<em>Multiline=false:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
libstdc++ r206594
</p></li>
<li><p>
libc++ r199174
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Multiline=true:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Visual Studio Express 2013
</p></li>
<li><p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The following constructors in 20.14.12.2 [func.wrap.func] are declared <tt>noexcept</tt>, even
though it is not possible for an implementation to guarantee that they will not throw:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp;) noexcept;
template &lt;class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp;, nullptr_t) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In addition, the following functions are guaranteed not to throw if the target
is a function pointer or a <tt>reference_wrapper</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp; a, const function&amp; f);
template &lt;class F, class A&gt; function(allocator_arg_t, const A&amp; a, F f);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In all of the above cases, the function object might need to allocate memory
(an operation that can throw) in order to hold a copy of the type-erased
allocator itself. The first two constructors produce an empty function
object, but the allocator is still needed in case the object is later assigned
to. In this case, we note that the propagation of allocators on assignment is
underspecified for <tt>std::function</tt>. There are three possibilities:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The allocator is never copied on copy-assignment, moved on move-assignment, or swapped on swap.</p>
</li>

<li><p>The allocator is always copied on copy-assignment, moved on move-assignment, and swapped on swap.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Whether or not the allocator is copied, moved, or swapped is determined at
   run-time based on the <tt>propagate_on_container_copy_assignment</tt> and
   <tt>propagate_on_container_move_assignment</tt> traits of the allocators at
   construction of the source function, the target function, or both.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Although the third option seems to be the most consistent with existing
wording in the containers section of the standard, it is problematic in a
number of respects. To begin with, the propagation behavior is determined at
run time based on a pair of type-erased allocators, instead of at compile
time. Such run-time logic is <em>not</em> consistent with the rest of the standard
and is hard to reason about. Additionally, there are two allocator types
involved, rather than one. Any set of rules that attempts to rationally
interpret the propagation traits of both allocators is likely to be arcane
at best, and subtly wrong for some set of codes at worst.
</p>

<p>
The second option is a non-starter. Historically, and in the vast majority of
existing code, an allocator does not change after an object is constructed.
The second option, if adopted, would undermine the programmer's ability to
construct, e.g., an array of function objects, all using the same allocator.
</p>

<p>
The first option is (in Pablo's opinion) the simplest and best. It is
consistent with historical use of allocators, is easy to understand, and
requires minimal wording. It is also consistent with the wording in N3916,
which formalizes type-erased allocators.
</p>

<p>
For cross-referencing purposes: The resolution of this issue should be
harmonized with any resolution to LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2062">2062</a>, which questions the <tt>noexcept</tt>
specification on the following member functions of std::function:
</p>

void swap(function&amp;) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Regarding 21.3.1 [basic.string], <tt>std::basic_string&lt;charT&gt;::data()</tt> returns a <tt>const charT*</tt> 
21.3.1.7.1 [string.accessors]. While this method is convenient, it doesn't quite match <tt>std::array&lt;T&gt;::data()</tt> 
23.3.7.5 [array.data] or <tt>std::vector&lt;T&gt;::data()</tt> 23.3.11.4 [vector.data], both of which provide two 
versions (that return <tt>T*</tt> or <tt>const T*</tt>). An additional <tt>data()</tt> method can be added to 
<tt>std::basic_string</tt> that returns a <tt>charT*</tt> so it can be used in similar situations that <tt>std::array</tt> and 
<tt>std::vector</tt> can be used. Without a non-<tt>const</tt> <tt>data()</tt> method, <tt>std::basic_string</tt> has to be treated 
specially in code that is otherwise oblivious to the container type being used.
<p/>
Adding a <tt>charT*</tt> return type to <tt>data()</tt> would be equivalent to doing <tt>&amp;str[0]</tt> or <tt>&amp;str.front()</tt>.
<p/>
Small discussion on the issue can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7518732/why-are-stdvectordata-and-stdstringdata-different">here</a>
and in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!topic/std-discussion/ll9HuEML6zo/discussion">std-discussion thread</a>  
(which didn't get too much attention).
<p/>
This requires a small change to <tt>std::basic_string</tt>'s definition in 21.3.1 [basic.string] to add the method to 
<tt>std::basic_string</tt>, and another small change in 21.3.1.7.1 [string.accessors] to define the new method.

22.3.1.3 [locale.members] p5 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Returns</i>: The name of <tt>*this</tt>, if it has one; otherwise, the string <tt>"*"</tt>. If <tt>*this</tt> has a name, then

</p></blockquote>
<p>
So&hellip; what is implementation-defined here, exactly? The first sentence <em>completely</em> defines the behavior of this function 
in all cases.
<p/>
Also, the second sentence says (effectively) that all locales with the same name are equivalent: given <tt>L1</tt> and <tt>L2</tt> 
that have the same name <tt>N</tt>, they are both equivalent to <tt>locale(N)</tt>, and since there is no definition of 
"equivalent" specific to <tt>locale</tt>, I assume it's the normal transitive equivalence property, which would imply that 
<tt>L1</tt> is equivalent to <tt>L2</tt>. I'm not sure why this central fact is in the description of <tt>locale::name</tt>, nor 
why it's written in this roundabout way.

Otherwise, one could use <tt>memcpy</tt> to save and restore the value according to 3.9p2.
<p/>
It seems the core language rules in 9 [class]p6 with 12.8 [class.copy]p12 
(trivial copy constructor) etc. and 8.4.2 [dcl.fct.def.default]p5 (user-provided) say 
that the atomic types are trivially copyable, which is bad. We shouldn't rely on future core 
changes in that area and simply say in the library section 29.5 [atomics.types.generic] 
that these very special types are not trivially copyable.

</p>

<p><i>[2015-03-22, Jens Maurer responses to Cologne discussion]</i></p>

<p>
A library implementation could provide a partial specialization for <tt>is_trivially_copyable&lt;atomic&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>, 
to ensure that any such type query would return <tt>false</tt>.
<p/>
Assuming such a specialization would be provided, how could a conforming program observe that per 
language rules an <tt>atomic</tt> specialization would actually be trivially copyable if there 
is no way to call the (deleted) copy constructor or copy assignment operator?
<p/>
The sole effect of the suggested addition of the constraining sentence is that it would make a user program
non-conforming that attempts to invoke <tt>memcpy</tt> (and the like) on <tt>atomic</tt> types, since that
would invoke undefined behaviour.

<p>Howard: is it reasonable to memcpy something that isn't trivially copy constructible or trivially assignable?</p>
<p>Jonathan: no, it's not, but Core says you can, so this resolution is needed to stop people memcpying atomic</p>
<p>Howard: we should fix the core rule</p>
<p>Marshall: there is a separate issue of whether trivially-copyable makes sense, but this resolution is a net good purely because it stops memcpy of atomics</p>
<p>Howard: so should implementations specialize is_trivially_copyable the trait to meet this?</p>
<p>Jonathan: or add an empty, user-defined destructor.</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
When experimenting with C++14 relaxed <tt>constexpr</tt> functions I made the observation that I couldn't 
use <tt>std::array</tt> to create a table of data at compile time directly using loops in a function. 
However, a simple substitute I could use instead:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template &lt;typename T, size_t n&gt;
struct ar {
  T a[n];
  constexpr ar() : a{{}}{}
  constexpr auto data() const { return &amp;a[0];}
  constexpr T const &amp; operator[](size_t i) const { return a[i]; }
  constexpr T &amp; operator[](size_t i) { return a[i]; }
};

template &lt;size_t n&gt;
using arr = ar&lt;size_t, n&gt;; // std::array&lt;size_t, n&gt;;

template &lt;size_t n&gt;
constexpr auto make_tab(){
  arr&lt;n&gt; result;
  for(size_t i=0; i &lt; n; ++i)
    result[i] = (i+1)*(i+1); // cannot define operator[] for mutable array...
  return result;
}

template &lt;size_t n&gt;
constexpr auto squares=make_tab&lt; n&gt;();

int main() {
  int dummy[squares&lt;5&gt;[3]];
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Therefore, I suggest that all member functions of <tt>std::array</tt> should be made <tt>constexpr</tt> 
to make the type usable in <tt>constexpr</tt> functions.
<p/>
Wording should be straight forward, may be with the exception of <tt>fill</tt>, which would require 
<tt>fill_n</tt> to be <tt>constexpr</tt> as well.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
LWG issue <a href="lwg-defects.html#2408">2408</a> changes the meat of the specification of <tt>common_type</tt> to compute:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] the type, if any, of an unevaluated conditional expression (5.16) whose first operand is an 
arbitrary value of type <tt>bool</tt>, whose second operand is an <tt>xvalue</tt> of type <tt>T1</tt>, 
and whose third operand is an xvalue of type <tt>T2</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This has an effect on the specification that I think was unintended. It used to be the case that 
<tt>common_type&lt;T&amp;, U&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt> would consider the type of a conditional between an 
lvalue of type <tt>T</tt> and an xvalue of type <tt>U</tt>. It's now either invalid (because there is 
no such thing as an xvalue of reference type) or considers the type of a conditional between an xvalue 
of type <tt>T</tt> and an xvalue of type <tt>U</tt>, depending on how you choose to read it.
<p/>
Put another way, this has the effect of changing the usual definition from:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
typedef decay_t&lt;decltype(true ? declval&lt;T&gt;() : declval&lt;U&gt;())&gt; type;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
typedef decay_t&lt;decltype(true ? declval&lt;remove_reference_t&lt;T&gt;&gt;() : declval&lt;remove_reference_t&lt;U&gt;&gt;())&gt; type;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It also makes <tt>common_type</tt> underspecified in the case where one of the operands is of type <tt>void</tt>; 
in that case, the resulting type depends on whether the expression is a throw-expression, which is not 
specified (but used to be).
<p/>
Also on the subject of this wording: the changes to 24.4.1 [iterator.traits] say that 
<tt>iterator_traits&lt;T&gt;</tt> "shall have no members" in some cases. That's wrong. It's a class type; 
it always has at least a copy constructor, a copy assignment operator, and a destructor. Plus this 
removes the usual library liberty to add additional members with names that don't collide with normal 
usage (for instance, if a later version of the standard adds members, they can't be present here as a 
conforming extension). Perhaps this should instead require that the class doesn't have members with any 
of those five names? That's what <a href="lwg-defects.html#2408">2408</a> does for <tt>common_type</tt>'s type member.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08 Chicago]</i></p>

<p>This issue has two parts, one dealing with <tt>common_type</tt>, the other with <tt>iterator_traits</tt>. 
The first of these is resolved by <a href="lwg-active.html#2465">2465</a>.  See below for the proposed resolution for the other one.</p>

<p>
Suppose we write
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
vector&lt;string&gt; v{"a", "b", "c", "d"};
v = move(v);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
What should be the state of <tt>v</tt> be? The standard doesn't say anything specific about self-move-assignment. 
There's relevant text in several parts of the standard, and it's not clear how to reconcile them.
<p/>
17.6.4.9 [res.on.arguments] writes that, for all functions in the standard library, unless explicitly stated 
otherwise, "If a function argument binds to an rvalue reference parameter, the implementation may assume that this 
parameter is a unique reference to this argument." The <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements table in 
17.6.3.1 [utility.arg.requirements] writes that, given <tt>t = rv</tt>, <tt>t</tt>'s state is equivalent to 
<tt>rv</tt>'s from before the assignment and <tt>rv</tt>'s state is unspecified (but valid). For containers 
specifically, the requirements table in 23.2.1 [container.requirements.general] says that, given <tt>a = rv</tt>, 
<tt>a</tt> becomes equal to what <tt>rv</tt> was before the assignment (and doesn't say anything about <tt>rv</tt>'s 
state post-assignment).
<p/>
Taking each of these pieces in isolation, without reference to the other two:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>17.6.4.9 [res.on.arguments] would clearly imply that the effect of <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is undefined.</p></li>
<li><p>17.6.3.1 [utility.arg.requirements] would clearly imply that <tt>v = move(v)</tt> has defined behavior. 
It might be read to imply that this is a no-op, or might be read to imply that it leaves <tt>v</tt> in a valid but 
unspecified state; I'm not sure which reading is more natural.</p></li>
<li><p>23.2.1 [container.requirements.general] would clearly imply that <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is a no-op.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
It's not clear from the text how to put these pieces together, because it's not clear which one takes precedence.  
Maybe 17.6.4.9 [res.on.arguments] wins (it imposes an implicit precondition that isn't mentioned in the 
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements, so <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is undefined), or maybe 
23.2.1 [container.requirements.general] wins (it explicitly gives additional guarantees for 
<tt>Container::operator=</tt> beyond what's guaranteed for library functions in general, so <tt>v = move(v)</tt> 
is a no-op), or maybe something else.
<p/>
On the existing implementations that I checked, for what it's worth, <tt>v = move(v)</tt> appeared to clear the vector; 
it didn't leave the vector unchanged and it didn't cause a crash.
<p/>
<em>Proposed wording</em>:
<p/>
Informally: change the <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> and Container requirements tables (and any other requirements tables 
that mention move assignment, if any) to make it explicit that <tt>x = move(x)</tt> is defined behavior and it leaves 
<tt>x</tt> in a valid but unspecified state. That's probably not what the standard says today, but it's probably what 
we intended and it's consistent with what we've told users and with what implementations actually do.
</p>

<p><i>[2015-10, Kona Saturday afternoon]</i></p>

<p>JW: So far, the library forbids self-assignment since it assumes that anything bound to an rvalue reference has no aliases. But self-assignment can happen in real code, and it can be implemented. So I want to add an exception to the Standard that this should be allowed and leave the object in a valid-but-unspecified state.</p>
<p>STL: When this is resolved, I want to see a) VBU for library types after self-move, but also b) requirements on user types for self-moves. E.g. should algorithms be required to avoid self-assignments (since a user-defined type might blow up)? HH: In other words, should we require that you can assign from moved-from values.</p>
<p>WEB: What can one generally do with moved-from values?</p>
<p>VV: Call any member function that has no preconditions.</p>
<p>JW: That's certainly the library requirement, and it's also good guidance for user types.</p>
<p>JW: I'm writing wording. I care about this.</p>

<p><i>[2016-08-07, Daniel reopens]</i></p>

<p>
With the acceptance of LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2598">2598</a>, the proposed wording is invalid code, because it attempts to
call <code>std::addressof</code> with an rvalue argument. It should be pointed out that the new restriction 
caused by <a href="lwg-active.html#2598">2598</a> doesn't affect real code, because any identity test within a move assignment
operator (or any comparable function) would act on the current function argument, which is an lvalue in the
context of the function body. The existing wording form of the issue could still be kept, if a helper variable
would be introduced such as:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<ins>Let <code>refrv</code> denote a reference initialized as if by <code>const T&amp; refrv = rv;</code>. Then 
if <code>addressof(t) != addressof(refrv)</code>,</ins> <code>t</code> is equivalent to the value of <code>rv</code> 
before the assignment
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But it seems to me that the same effect could be much easier realized by replacing the code form by 
a non-code English phrase that realizes the same effect.

<p>
The current P/R of LWG 2468 simply adds to <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> the requirement to tolerate self-move-assignment, 
but that doesn't actually do much about self-move-assignment of library types. Very few types in the library are 
explicitly required to satisfy <tt>MoveAssignable</tt>, so as written the restriction in 17.6.4.9 [res.on.arguments]

<h3><a name="2475" href="#2475">2475.</a> Allow overwriting of <tt>std::basic_string</tt> terminator with <tt>charT()</tt> to allow

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
It is often desirable to use a <tt>std::basic_string</tt> object as a buffer when interoperating with libraries 
that mutate null-terminated arrays of characters. In many cases, these legacy APIs write a null terminator at 
the specified end of the provided buffer. Providing such a function with an appropriately-sized 
<tt>std::basic_string</tt> results in undefined behavior when the <tt>charT</tt> object at the <tt>size()</tt> 
position is overwritten, even if the value remains unchanged.
<p/>
Absent the ability to allow for this, applications are forced into pessimizations such as: providing 
appropriately-sized <tt>std::vectors</tt> of <tt>charT</tt> for interoperating with the legacy API, and then 
copying the <tt>std::vector</tt> to a <tt>std::basic_string</tt>; providing an oversized <tt>std::basic_string</tt> 
object and then calling <tt>resize()</tt> later.
<p/>
A trivial example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

void legacy_function(char *out, size_t count) {
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i) {
    *out++ = '0' + (i % 10);
  }
  *out = '\0'; // <span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">if size() == count, this results in undefined behavior</span>
}

int main() {
  std::string s(10, '\0');
  legacy_function(&amp;s[0], s.size()); // <span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">undefined behavior</span>

  std::vector&lt;char&gt; buffer(11);
  legacy_function(&amp;buffer[0], buffer.size() - 1);
  std::string t(&amp;buffer[0], buffer.size() - 1); // potentially expensive copy

  std::string u(11, '\0');
  legacy_function(&amp;u[0], u.size() - 1);
  u.resize(u.size() - 1); // needlessly complicates the program's logic
}
</pre>

<p>
A slight relaxation of the requirement on the returned object from the element access operator would 
allow for this interaction with no semantic change to existing programs.

<h3><a name="2501" href="#2501">2501.</a> <tt>std::function</tt> requires POCMA/POCCA</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The idea behind <tt>propagate_on_container_move_assignment</tt> is that you can keep an allocator attached to a container. 
But it's not really designed to work with polymorphism, which introduces the condition where the current allocator is non-POCMA 
and the RHS of assignment, being POCMA, wants to replace it. If function were to respect the literal meaning, any would-be 
attached allocator is at the mercy of every assignment operation. So, <tt>std::function</tt> is inherently POCMA, and passing 
a non-POCMA allocator should be ill-formed.
<p/>
The other alternative, and the status quo, is to ignore POCMA and assume it is true. This seems just dangerous enough to outlaw. 
It is, in theory, possible to properly support POCMA as far as I can see, albeit with difficulty and brittle results. It would 
require function to keep a throwing move constructor, which otherwise can be <tt>noexcept</tt>.
<p/>
The same applies to <tt>propagate_on_container_copy_assignment</tt>. This presents more difficulty because <tt>std::allocator</tt> 
does not set this to true. Perhaps it should. For function to respect this would require inspecting the POCCA of the source allocator, 
slicing the target from the erasure of the source, slicing the allocation from the erasure of the destination, and performing a 
copy with the destination's allocator with the source's target. This comes out of the blue for the destination allocator, which 
might not support the new type anyway. Theoretically possible, but brittle and not very practical. Again, current implementations 
quietly ignore the issue but this isn't very clean.
<p/>
The following code example is intended to demonstrate the issue here:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;functional&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct diag_alloc 
{
  std::string name;

  T* allocate(std::size_t n) const 
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; '+' &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; '\n';
    return static_cast&lt;T*&gt;(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
  }
  
  void deallocate(T* p, std::size_t) const 
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; '-' &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; '\n';
    return ::operator delete(p);
  }

  template &lt;typename U&gt;
  operator diag_alloc&lt;U&gt;() const { return {name}; }

  friend bool operator==(const diag_alloc&amp; a, const diag_alloc&amp; b)
  { return a.name == b.name; }
  
  friend bool operator!=(const diag_alloc&amp; a, const diag_alloc&amp; b)
  { return a.name != b.name; }

  typedef T value_type;
  
  template &lt;typename U&gt;
  struct rebind { typedef diag_alloc&lt;U&gt; other; };
};

int main() {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "VECTOR\n";
  std::vector&lt;int, diag_alloc&lt;int&gt;&gt; foo({1, 2}, {"foo"}); // +foo
  std::vector&lt;int, diag_alloc&lt;int&gt;&gt; bar({3, 4}, {"bar"}); // +bar

  foo = std::move(bar); // no message

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "more foo\n";

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In C++14 sub-clause 99 [auto.ptr.conv], there appears to be no requirement that the formation of an 
<tt>auto_ptr_ref&lt;Y&gt;</tt> from an <tt>auto_ptr&lt;X&gt;</tt> is done only when <tt>X*</tt> can be implicitly 
converted to <tt>Y*</tt>.
<p/>
For example, I expect formation of the <tt>auto_ptr_ref&lt;A&gt;</tt> from the prvalue of type <tt>auto_ptr&lt;B&gt;</tt> 
to be invalid in the case below (but the wording does not seem to be there):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;memory&gt;

struct A { };
struct B { } b;

std::auto_ptr&lt;B&gt; apB() { return std::auto_ptr&lt;B&gt;(&amp;b); }
int main() {
  std::auto_ptr&lt;A&gt; apA(apB());
  apA.release();
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The behaviour of the implementation in question on the case presented above is to compile and execute it successfully 
(which is what the C++14 wording implies). The returned value from <tt>apA.release()</tt> is essentially 
<tt>reinterpret_cast&lt;A*&gt;(&amp;b)</tt>.
<p/>
There is nothing in the specification of
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class X&gt;
template &lt;class Y&gt; operator auto_ptr&lt;X&gt;::auto_ptr_ref&lt;Y&gt;() throw();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
which implies that <tt>X*</tt> should be implicitly convertible to <tt>Y*</tt>.
<p/>
The implementation in question uses the <tt>reinterpret_cast</tt> interpretation even when <tt>Y</tt> is an accessible, 
unambiguous base class of <tt>X</tt>; the result thereof is that no offset adjustment is performed.

<p>
<tt>std::experimental::optional</tt>, for certain reasons, specifies its <tt>nullopt</tt> type
to not be <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>. It doesn't do so for its tag type <tt>in_place_t</tt>
and neither does the standard proper for any of its tag types. That turns
out to be very unfortunate, consider the following:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;memory&gt;
#include &lt;array&gt;

void f(std::array&lt;int, 1&gt;, int) {} // #1
void f(std::allocator_arg_t, int) {} // #2

int main()
{
  f({}, 666); // #3
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The call at #3 is ambiguous. What's even worse is that if the overload #1
is removed, the call works just fine. The whole point of a tag type is that
it either needs to mentioned in a call or it needs to be a forwarded argument,
so being able to construct a tag type like that makes no sense.
<p/>
Making the types have an <em>explicit default constructor</em> might have helped, but 
<a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_active.html#1518">CWG 1518</a>

<p/>

<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
In subclause 24.2.7 [random.access.iterators], Table 110, the operational semantics for the expression "<tt>r -= n</tt>" 
are defined as
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
return r += -n;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Given a <tt>difference_type</tt> of a type <tt>int</tt> with range [-32768, 32767], if the value of <tt>n</tt> is -32768, 
then the evaluation of <tt>-n</tt> causes undefined behaviour (Clause 5 [expr] paragraph 4).
<p/>
The operational semantics may be changed such that the undefined behaviour is avoided.
<p/>
<b>Suggested wording:</b>
<p/>
Replace the operational semantics for "<tt>r -= n</tt>" with:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
{ 
  difference_type m = n;
  if (m >= 0)
    while (m--)
      --r;
  else
    while (m++)
      ++r;
  return r; 
}

<p>
Jonathan Wakely:
<p/>
I'm now convinced we <em>don't</em> want to change the definition of <tt>-=</tt> and
instead we should explicitly state the (currently implicit)
precondition that <tt>n != numeric_limits&lt;difference_type&gt;::min()</tt>.

<h3><a name="2529" href="#2529">2529.</a> Assigning to <tt>enable_shared_from_this::__weak_this</tt> twice</h3>

<p>
It is unclear what should happen if a pointer to an object with an
<tt>enable_shared_from_this</tt> base is passed to two different <tt>shared_ptr</tt>
constructors.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;memory&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  struct X : public enable_shared_from_this&lt;X&gt; { };
  auto xraw = new X;
  shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp1(xraw);  // #1
  {
    shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp2(xraw, [](void*) { });  // #2
  }
  xraw-&gt;shared_from_this();  // #3
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is similar to LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2179">2179</a>, but involves no undefined behaviour due
to the no-op deleter, and the question is not whether the second
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> should share ownership with the first, but which <tt>shared_ptr</tt>
shares ownership with the <tt>enable_shared_from_this::__weak_this</tt> member.
<p/>
With all three of the major <tt>std::shared_ptr</tt> implementations the <tt>xp2</tt>
constructor modifies the <tt>__weak_this</tt> member so the last line of the
program throws <tt>bad_weak_ptr</tt>, even though all the requirements on the 
<tt>shared_from_this()</tt> function are met (20.11.2.5 [util.smartptr.enab])/7:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires</i>: <tt>enable_shared_from_this&lt;T&gt;</tt> shall be an accessible base class
of <tt>T</tt>. <tt>*this</tt> shall be a subobject of an object <tt>t</tt> of type <tt>T</tt>. There shall
be at least one <tt>shared_ptr</tt> instance <tt>p</tt> that owns <tt>&amp;t</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Boost doesn't update <tt>__weak_this</tt>, leaving it sharing with <tt>xp1</tt>, so the
program doesn't throw. That change was made to <tt>boost::enable_shared_from_this</tt> because 
someone reported exactly this issue as a bug, see <a href="https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2584">Boost issue 2584</a>.
<p/>
On the reflector Peter Dimov explained that there are real-world use
cases that rely on the Boost behaviour, and none which rely on the
behaviour of the current <tt>std::shared_ptr</tt> implementations. We should
specify the behaviour of <tt>enable_shared_from_this</tt> more precisely, and
resolve this issue one way or another.

<p>
The rvalue stream insertion and extraction operators should be constrained to not participate in overload 
resolution unless the expression they evaluate is well-formed. Programming code that tests the validity of 
stream insertions (or extractions) using SFINAE can result in false positives, as the present 
declarations accept virtually any right-hand side argument. Moreover, there is no need for pollution of 
the candidate set with ill-formed specializations.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
I have been wondering about the C++ standard requirements regarding the hint iterator for insertion into an 
<tt>unordered_multimap</tt> (and I imagine a similar question could be asked of <tt>unordered_map</tt>, but 
I have not researched that topic). As far as I can tell, it seems perfectly valid for an implementation to 
allow only valid dereferencable iterators to be used as the hint argument for this member function. If that 
is correct, it means that one could not expect the end iterator to be used as a valid hint nor could one use 
the begin iterator of an empty <tt>unordered_multimap</tt> as the hint. However, this essentially precludes 
all uses of inserter on an empty <tt>unordered_multimap</tt> seeing as the inserter functor requires that a 
hint iterator be passed to its constructor.
<p/>
Howard Hinnant:
</p>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>
The intent of the standard is that the iterator produced from container <tt>c</tt> by <tt>c.end()</tt> is a 
valid (but non-dereferenceable) iterator into container <tt>c</tt>. It is reachable by every other iterator 
into <tt>c</tt>.
<p/>
It appears to me that you and the Bloomberg implementation have fallen victim to a type-o in the Unordered 
associative container requirements, Table 102.  The row containing:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a.insert(q, t);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
should read instead:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a.insert(p, t);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The distinction is that <tt>p</tt> is valid, and <tt>q</tt> is both valid and dereferenceable.
The correction of this type-o would make unordered container <tt>insert</tt> consistent with unordered <tt>emplace_hint</tt>, 
associative <tt>insert</tt>, and associative <tt>emplace_hint</tt>.

<h3><a name="2543" href="#2543">2543.</a> LWG 2148 (hash support for enum types) seems under-specified</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The rationale in issue <a href="lwg-defects.html#2148">2148</a> says:
</p>
<blockquote class="note"><p>
This proposed resolution doesn't specify anything else about the
primary template, allowing implementations to do whatever they want
for non-enums: <tt>static_assert</tt> nicely, explode horribly at compiletime
or runtime, etc.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
libc++ seems to implement it by defining the primary template and
<tt>static_assert</tt>ing <tt>is_enum</tt> inside it. However, that brings forth
a problem; there are reasonable SFINAE uses broken by it:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;

class S{}; // No hash specialization

template&lt;class T&gt;
auto f(int) -&gt; decltype(std::hash&lt;T&gt;(), std::true_type());

template&lt;class T&gt;
auto f(...) -&gt; decltype(std::false_type());

static_assert(!decltype(f&lt;S&gt;(0))::value, "");
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
MSVC doesn't seem to accept that code either.
<p/>
There <em>is</em> a way to implement LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#2148">2148</a> so that <tt>hash</tt> for enums is supported
without breaking that sort of SFINAE uses:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Derive the main <tt>hash</tt> template from a library-internal uglified-named
base template that takes a type and a <tt>bool</tt>, pass as argument for the base
the result of <tt>is_enum</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Partially specialize that base template so that the false-case has
a suitable set of private special member function declarations so that it's not
an aggregate nor usable in almost any expression.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2015-10, Kona Saturday afternoon]</i></p>

<p>EricWF to come back with wording; move to Open</p>

<p><i>[2016-05-08, Eric Fiselier &amp; Ville provide wording]</i></p>


<p><i>[2016-05-25, Tim Song comments]</i></p>

<p>
I see two issues with this P/R:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
"for which neither the library nor the user provides an explicit specialization" should probably be "for which neither 
the library nor the user provides an explicit or partial specialization".
</p></li>
<li><p>
Saying that the specialization "is not <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt> nor <tt>MoveAssignable</tt>" is not enough to 
guarantee that common SFINAE uses will work. Both of those requirements have several parts, and it's not too hard 
to fail only some of them. For instance, not meeting the assignment postcondition breaks <tt>MoveAssignable</tt>, 
but is usually not SFINAE-detectible. And for <tt>DefaultConstructible</tt>, it's easy to write something in a way 
that breaks <tt>T()</tt> but not <tt>T{}</tt> (due to aggregate initialization in the latter case).
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2016-06-14, Daniel comments]</i></p>

<p>
The problematic part of the P/R is that it describes constraints that would be suitable if they were constraints 
for user-code, but they are not suitable as requirements imposed on implementations to provide certain guarantees 
for clients of the Library. The guarantees should be written in terms of testable compile-time expressions, e.g. based on 
negative results of <tt>is_default_constructible&lt;hash&lt;X&gt;&gt;::value</tt>, 
<tt>std::is_copy_constructible&lt;hash&lt;X&gt;&gt;::value</tt>, and possibly also 
<tt>std::is_destructible&lt;hash&lt;X&gt;&gt;::value</tt>. <em>How</em> an implementation realizes these negative 
results shouldn't be specified, though, but the expressions need to be well-formed and well-defined.

<p>
N4527 24.6.3.2 [istreambuf.iterator.cons] does not mention what the effect of calling 
<tt>istreambuf_iterator(basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits&gt;* s)</tt> is when <tt>s</tt> is a null pointer. 
It should be made clear that this case is well-formed and the result is a end-of-stream iterator.
<p/>
Daniel:
<p/>
According to 24.6.3 [istreambuf.iterator] p1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] The default constructor <tt>istreambuf_iterator()</tt> and the constructor <tt>istreambuf_iterator(0)</tt> both 
construct an end-of-stream iterator object suitable for use as an end-of-range. [&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This indicates that the described constructor creates an end-of-stream iterator, but this wording is part of the introductory 
wording and I recommend to make 24.6.3.2 [istreambuf.iterator.cons] clearer, because the existing specification is already
flawed, e.g. it never specifies when and how the exposition-only-member <tt>sbuf_</tt> is initialized. The proposed wording 
below attempts to solve these problems as well.

<p>
N4567 20.14.6 [comparisons]/14 specifies that the comparison functors provide a total ordering for pointer types:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
For templates <tt>greater</tt>, <tt>less</tt>, <tt>greater_equal</tt>, and <tt>less_equal</tt>, the specializations for 
any pointer type yield a total order, even if the built-in operators <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt> 
do not.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It notably does not specify:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>whether the specializations of all of the named templates for a given pointer type yield the <em>same</em> total order</p></li>
<li><p>whether the total order imposed respects the partial order imposed by the built-in operators</p></li>
<li><p>whether the total order imposed is consistent with the partition induced by <tt>==</tt></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
All of which are important for sane semantics and provided by common implementations, since the built-in operators provide 
a total order and the comparison functors yield that same order.
<p/>
It would be extremely confusing &mdash; if not outright insane &mdash; for e.g.:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>less&lt;int*&gt;</tt> and <tt>greater&lt;int*&gt;</tt> to yield different orders</p></li>
<li><p><tt>less&lt;int*&gt;</tt> to disagree with <tt>&lt;</tt> on the relative order of two pointers for which <tt>&lt;</tt> 
is defined</p></li>
<li><p><tt>less&lt;int*&gt;</tt> to order <tt>a</tt> before <tt>b</tt> when <tt>a == b</tt>, i.e., not preserve equality.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Consistent semantics for the various comparison functors and the built-in operators is so intuitive as to be assumed by most programmers.

<p><i>[2016-05-20, Casey Carter comments and suggests revised wording]</i></p>

<p>
The new proposed wording is attempting to address the issue raised in the 2016-02-04 telecon.
<p/>
The real issue I'm trying to address here is ensure that "weird" implementations provide the same kind of consistency 
for pointer orderings as "normal" implementations that use a flat address spaces and have totally ordered <tt>&lt;</tt>. 
If <tt>a &lt; b</tt> is true for <tt>int</tt> pointers <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>, then <tt>less&lt;int*&gt;(a, b)</tt>, 
<tt>less_equal&lt;int*&gt;(a, b)</tt>, <tt>less&lt;char*&gt;(a, b)</tt>, <tt>less&lt;void*&gt;(a, b)</tt>, and 
<tt>greater&lt;int*&gt;(b, a)</tt> should all hold. I <em>think</em> this wording is sufficient to provide that.

<p>
The specification of <tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt> uses the term <tt>BaseCharacteristic</tt>, which 
is problematic in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That term is defined in 20.15.1 [meta.rqmts], but only for <tt>UnaryTypeTraits</tt> and <tt>BinaryTypeTraits</tt>. 
<tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt> seem to be neither.</p></li>
<li><p>20.15.1 [meta.rqmts] also requires the <tt>BaseCharacteristic</tt> for both <tt>UnaryTypeTraits</tt> and 
<tt>BinaryTypeTraits</tt> to be a specialization of <tt>integral_constant</tt>, which is inconsistent with the current design of 
<tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>The requirement in 20.15.1 [meta.rqmts] that "member names of the <tt>BaseCharacteristic</tt> shall not be hidden 
and shall be unambiguously available" seems impossible to meet in every case, since the arbitrary base class from which a 
specialization of <tt>conjunction</tt> or <tt>disjunction</tt> derives may contain members called <tt>conjunction</tt> or 
<tt>disjunction</tt> that will necessarily be hidden.</p></li>

Merged the resolution of <a href="lwg-active.html#2587">2587</a> with this issue. This proposed resolution
resolves both, and includes fixes from Daniel for negation.

<p>
20.15.8 [meta.logical]/2 and /5 impose the following requirement on the arguments of <tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every template type argument shall be usable as a base class and shall have a static data member value which is convertible to 
<tt>bool</tt>, is not hidden, and is unambiguously available in the type.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Since the requirement is unconditional, it applies even to type arguments whose instantiation is not required due to short circuiting.

99 [meta.logical]/2 and /5 impose the following requirement on the arguments of <tt>conjunction</tt> and <tt>disjunction</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every template type argument shall be usable as a base class and shall have a static data member value which is convertible to

<p>
Since the requirement is unconditional, it applies even to type arguments whose instantiation is not required due to short circuiting.

24.2 [iterator.requirements] attempts to establish requirements for iterators,
but 24.4.1 [iterator.traits]/1 establishes further requirements that must be met
in order to author a portable iterator that works with existing implementations.
Failing to meet the requirements of the latter will fail to work in practice.
The former requirements should reference the latter, normatively.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Stephan and I are seeing differences in implementation for how non-special characters should be handled in the 
<tt>IdentityEscape</tt> part of the ECMAScript grammar. For example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#ifdef USE_BOOST
#include &lt;boost/regex.hpp&gt;
using namespace boost;
#else
#include &lt;regex&gt;
#endif
using namespace std;

int main() {
  try {
    const regex r("\\z");
    cout &lt;&lt; "Constructed \\z." &lt;&lt; endl;
    if (regex_match("z", r))
      cout &lt;&lt; "Matches z" &lt;&lt; endl;
  } catch (const regex_error&amp; e) {
      cout &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
libstdc++, boost, and browsers I tested with (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome) all happily interpret <tt>\z</tt>, which 
otherwise has no meaning, as an identity character escape for the letter <tt>z</tt>.
libc++ and msvc++ say that this is invalid, and throw <tt>regex_error</tt> with <tt>error_escape</tt>.
<p/>
ECMAScript 3 (which is what C++ currently points to) seems to agree with libc++ and msvc++:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
IdentityEscape ::
  SourceCharacter <b>but not</b> IdentifierPart

IdentifierPart ::
  IdentifierStart
  UnicodeCombiningMark
  UnicodeDigit
  UnicodeConnectorPunctuation
  \ UnicodeEscapeSequence

IdentifierStart ::
  UnicodeLetter
  $
  _
  \ UnicodeEscapeSequence
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
But this doesn't make any sense &mdash; it prohibits things like <tt>\$</tt> which users absolutely need to be able to escape. 
So let's look at ECMAScript 6. I believe this says much the same thing, but updates the spec to better handle Unicode by 
referencing what the Unicode standard says is an identifier character:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
IdentityEscape ::
  SyntaxCharacter
  /
  SourceCharacter <b>but not</b> UnicodeIDContinue
  
UnicodeIDContinue ::
  any Unicode code point with the Unicode property "ID_Continue", "Other_ID_Continue", or "Other_ID_Start"
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, ECMAScript 6 has an appendix B defining "additional features for web browsers" which says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
IdentityEscape ::
  SourceCharacter <b>but not</b> c
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
which appears to agree with what libstdc++, boost, and browsers are doing.
<p/>
What should be the correct behavior here?

N4567 28.10 [re.results] p2 mentions
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The class template <tt>match_results</tt> shall satisfy the requirements of an allocator-aware container and of a
sequence container, as specifed in 23.2.3, except that only operations defined for const-qualified sequence

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, this is impossible because <tt>match_results</tt> has a <tt>operator==</tt> whose semantics differs from the one 
required in Table 95 &mdash; "Container requirements".
<p/>
Table 95 requires that <tt>a == b</tt> is an equivalence relation and means <tt>equal(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), b.end())</tt>. 
But for <tt>match_results</tt>, <tt>a == b</tt> and <tt>equal(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), b.end())</tt> can give different 
results. For example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;regex&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

int main()
{
  std::regex re("a*");
  std::string target("baaab");
  std::smatch a;

  std::regex_search(target, a, re);

  std::string target2("raaau");
  std::smatch b;

  std::regex_search(target2, b, re);

  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::boolalpha;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; (a == b) &lt;&lt; '\n'; // false
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::equal(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), b.end()) &lt;&lt; '\n'; // true
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p><i>[2016-02, Issues Telecon]</i></p>

Marshall: The submitter is absolutely right, but the proposed resolution is insufficient. We should avoid "shall", for once.<br/>

<p>
This issue is a spin-off of LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#2393">2393</a>, it solely focuses on the pre-condition of 20.14.12.2.5 [func.wrap.func.targ] p2:
</p>
<blockquote class="note"><p>
<i>Requires</i>: <tt>T</tt> shall be a type that is Callable (20.9.12.2) for parameter types <tt>ArgTypes</tt> and return type
<tt>R</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Originally, the author of this issue here had assumed that simply removing the precondition as a side-step of fixing LWG
<a href="lwg-defects.html#2393">2393</a> would be uncontroversial. Discussions on the 
<a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=38356">library reflector</a> indicated that this is not the case, 
although it seemed that there was agreement on removing the undefined behaviour edge-case.
<p/>
There exist basically the following positions:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The constraint should be removed completely, the function is considered as having a 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3279.pdf">wide contract</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The pre-condition should be replaced by a <i>Remarks</i> element, that has the effect of making the code ill-formed,
if <tt>T</tt> is a type that is not Lvalue-Callable (20.9.11.2) for parameter types <tt>ArgTypes</tt> and return type <tt>R</tt>.
Technically this approach is still conforming with a wide contract function, because the definition of this contract form
depends on runtime constraints.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Not yet explicitly discussed, but a possible variant of bullet (2) could be:
</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>The pre-condition should be replaced by a <i>Remarks</i> element, that has the effect of SFINAE-constraining
this member: "This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless  <tt>T</tt> is a type that is 
Lvalue-Callable (20.9.11.2) for parameter types <tt>ArgTypes</tt> and return type <tt>R</tt>".
</p></li>

<p>It reflects existing implementation practice, Visual Studio 2015 SR1, gcc 6 libstdc++, and clang 3.8.0 libc++ do accept

  std::cout &lt;&lt; f2.target&lt;void(*)()&gt;() &lt;&lt; std::endl;

and consistently output the implementation-specific result for <b>two null pointer</b> values.

</li>
<li>
<p>
The current
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/doc/html/boost/function_base.html">Boost documentation</a>
does not indicate <em>any</em> precondition for calling the <tt>target</tt> function, so it is natural
that programmers would expect similar specification and behaviour for the corresponding standard component.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There is a consistency argument in regard to the free function template <tt>get_deleter</tt>
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class D, class T&gt;

<li>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>
Programmers have control over the type they're passing to <tt>target&lt;T&gt;()</tt>. Passing a non-callable type 
can't possibly retrieve a non-null target, so it seems highly likely to be programmer error. Diagnosing that at 
compile time seems highly preferable to allowing this to return null, always, at runtime.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If <tt>T</tt> is a reference type then the return type <tt>T*</tt> is ill-formed anyway. This implies that one can't

<li>
<p>
It has been pointed out that some real world code, boiling down to

    <i>// slow path</i>
  }
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
had manifested as a performance issue and preparing a patch that made the library <tt>static_assert</tt> in that
case solved this problem (Note that <tt>decltype(foo)</tt> evaluates to <tt>void()</tt>, but a proper argument of
<tt>target()</tt> would have been the function <em>pointer</em> type <tt>void(*)()</tt>, because a function type 
<tt>void()</tt> is not any <i>Callable</i> type).

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It might be worth adding that if use case (2 c) is indeed an often occurring idiom, it would make sense to consider
to provide an explicit conversion to a function pointer (w/o template parameters that could be provided incorrectly), 
if the <tt>std::function</tt> object at runtime conditions contains a pointer to a real function, e.g.

<p>
  On Windows, the <code><del>FindFileData</del> <ins>WIN32_FIND_DATA</ins></code> structure, which is the underlying data type for <code>directory_entry</code>, contains the file size as one of the fields.

  Thus efficient enumeration of files and getting their sizes is possible without doing a separate query for the file size.

<h3><a name="2664" href="#2664">2664.</a> <code>operator/</code> (and other append) semantics not useful if argument has root</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
  In a recent discussion on the Boost developers mailing list, the semantics of <code>operator /</code>
  and other append operations were questioned:
<p/>
In brief, currently <code>p1 / p2</code> is required to concatenate the
  lexical representation of <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, inserting a
  preferred separator as needed.
<p/>
This means that, for example, <code>&quot;c:\x&quot; / &quot;d:\y&quot;</code> gives <code>
    &quot;c:\x\d:\y&quot;</code>, and that <code>&quot;c:\x&quot; / &quot;\\server\share&quot;</code>
    gives <code>&quot;c:\x\\server\share&quot;</code>. This is rarely, if ever, useful.
<p/>
An alternative interpretation of <code>p1 / p2</code> could be that it yields a
  path that is the approximation of what <code>p2</code> would mean if interpreted
  in an environment in which <code>p1</code> is the starting directory. 
  Under this interpretation, <code>&quot;c:\x&quot; / &quot;d:\y&quot;</code> gives <code>&quot;d:\y&quot;</code>,
  which is more likely to match what was intended.
<p/>
I am not saying that this second interpretation is the right one, but I do say
  that we have reasons to suspect that the first one (lexical concatenation using
  a separator) may not be entirely correct.
  This leads me to think that the behavior of <code>p1 / p2</code>, when <code>p2</code>
  has a root, needs to be left implementation-defined, so that implementations are
  not required to do the wrong thing, as above.
<p/>
This change will not affect the ordinary use case in which <code>p2</code> is a
  relative, root-less, path.

<p><i>[2016-02, Jacksonville]</i></p>

<p>Beman to provide wording.</p>

<p><i>[2016-06-13, Beman provides wording and rationale]</i></p>

<p>
<b>Rationale:</b> The purpose of the append operations is to provide a simple concatenation facility for users 
wishing to extend a path by appending one or more additional elements, and to do so without worrying about the 
details of when a separator is needed. In that context it makes no sense to provide an argument that has a 
<i>root-name</i>. The simplest solution is simply to require <code>!p.has_root_name()</code>.
The other suggested solutions IMO twist the functions into something harder to reason about
yet any advantages for users are purely speculative. The concatenation functions can
be used instead for corner cases.

<p>
The descriptions of most functions are explicit about the use of the <code>ec</code> argument,
  either saying something like "<code>foo(p)</code> or <code>foo(p, ec)</code>, respectively" or using the
  <code>ec</code> argument like <code>foo(p[, ec])</code>, but <code>is_empty</code> does not.
</p>
<p>
27.10.15.19 [fs.op.is_empty]/2 refers to <code>ec</code> unconditionally, but more importantly
  27.10.15.19 [fs.op.is_empty]/3 doesn't pass <code>ec</code> to the <code>directory_iterator</code>
  constructor or the <code>file_size</code> function.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>To fix multi-threading problems in <code>directory_entry</code>, caching behavior
was removed from the type. This is bad for performance reasons,
because the values can no longer be cached from the result of <code>readdir</code>
on POSIX platforms, or from <code>FindFirstFile/FindNextFile</code> on Windows.</p>

<p>It appears that the intent was to allow implementers to fill in the
values for <code>directory_entry::status</code> inside <code>directory_iterator</code>, but as
currently specified:</p>

    <blockquote><i>Returns:</i> <code>status(path()[, ec])</code>.</blockquote>

<p>This is not allowed to be cached, because the target of the path can
change. For example, consider the following program:</p>

<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;filesystem&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;

using namespace std;
namespace fs = ::std::filesystem;

void verify(const bool b, const char * const msg) {
    if (!b) {
        printf("fail: %s\n", msg);
        exit(1);
    }
}

void touch_file(const char * const filename) {
    ofstream f(filename);
    f &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; endl;
    verify(f.good(), "File write failed");
}

int main() {
    fs::remove_all("subDir");
    fs::create_directory("subDir");
    fs::create_directory("subDir/child");
    touch_file("subDir/child/child");
    fs::current_path("./subDir");
    fs::directory_iterator dir(".");
    ++dir;
    fs::directory_entry entry = *dir;

    verify(entry == "./child",
      "unexpected subdirectory"); //enumerating "subDir" returned the directory "child"

    fs::file_status status = entry.status();
    verify(status.type() == fs::file_type::directory,
        "subDir/child was not a directory");
    fs::current_path("./child");
    status = entry.status(); // REQUIRED to re-stat() on POSIX,
                             // GetFileAttributes() on Windows
    verify(status.type() == fs::file_type::regular,
        "subDir/child/child was not a regular file");
    return 0;
}</pre>

<p>
The enum class <tt>std::filesystem::file_type</tt> specifies a collection of enumerators for describing the type of 
a file, but also specifies (1) the numeric values of the enumerators, and (2) that an implementation cannot extend the 
list with additional types known to it (and by extension, the standard cannot extend the list in future versions without 
breakage).
</p>
<p>
These both seem like mistakes in the design. I would suggest we remove the 
specification of numerical values, and maybe also
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>we allow implementations to add new implementation-defined value</p></li>
  <li><p>we replace <tt>std::filesystem::file_type::unknown</tt> with a value that <em>only</em> 
  means &quot;exists but type could not be determined&quot; and use 
  implementation-specific values for other possibilities.</p></li>
</ul>
 <p>
 Similar overspecification exists for <tt>std::filesystem::copy_options</tt> and 
 <tt>std::filesystem::directory_options</tt>, where again precise numerical values are specified.

<p>27.10.15.3 [fs.op.copy] paragraph 3 bullet (3.4) says that if <code>is_symlink(f)</code> and
<code>copy_options</code> is set in options then it should copy a symlink, but that
case cannot be reached.</p>

<p><code>is_symlink(f)</code> can only be true if f was set using
<code>symlink_status(from)</code>, but that doesn't happen unless one of
<code>create_symlinks</code> or <code>skip_symlinks</code> is set in options. It should depend
on <code>copy_symlinks</code> too.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the correct behaviour is, but I don't think we
want to simply add a check for <code>copy_symlinks</code> in bullet (3.1) because
that would mean that <code>t = symlink_status(to)</code>, and I don't think we want
that. Consider <code>'touch file; mkdir dir; ln -s dir link;'</code> and then
<code>filesystem::copy("file", "link",
filesystem::copy_options::copy_symlinks)</code>. If <code>t = symlink_status(to)</code>
then <code>is_directory(t) == false</code>, and we don't use bullet (3.5.4) but go
to (3.5.5) instead and fail. So when <code>copy_symlinks</code> is set we still
need to use <code>t = status(to)</code> as specified today.</p>

Both <tt>error_code</tt> and <tt>error_condition</tt> have an <tt>operator&lt;</tt> overload,

<p>
However, only <tt>error_code</tt> has a <tt>std::hash</tt>

Class <tt>facet</tt> is the base class for locale feature sets. A class is a <i>facet</i> if it is publicly derived

LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#436">436</a>'s intent appears to be to ban <tt>volatile</tt>-qualified facets and permitting

it deleted the whole first half of the paragraph, including the definition of <i>facet</i> and the requirement 
for a static data member named <tt>id</tt>.

As a result, we have things like 22.3.1.1.3 [locale.id]/2 and 22.3.2 [locale.global.templates]/1 referring

<p>
For each public constructor of <tt>std::shared_ptr</tt>, the standard says that constructor <i>enables 
<tt>shared_from_this</tt></i> if that constructor is expected to initialize the internal <tt>weak_ptr</tt> 
of a contained <tt>enable_shared_from_this&lt;X&gt;</tt> object. But there are other ways to construct 
a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> than by using a public constructor. The template functions <tt>make_shared</tt> 
and <tt>allocate_shared</tt> both require calling a private constructor, since no public constructor 
can fulfill the requirement that at most one allocation is made. The standard does not specify that 
that private constructor enables <tt>shared_from_this</tt>; therefore in the following code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct Foo : public std::enable_shared_from_this&lt;Foo&gt; {};

int main() {
  auto p = std::make_shared&lt;Foo&gt;();
  assert(p == p-&gt;shared_from_this());
  return 0;
}

<p>
In N4582 subclause 26.3 [numeric.requirements], the "considerable flexibility in how arrays are initialized" 
do not appear to allow for replacement of calls to the default constructor with calls to the copy constructor with 
an appropriate source value.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08-03 Chicago]</i></p>

<p>Fri AM: Moved to Tentatively Ready</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
This wording is relative to N4582.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Adjust 26.3 [numeric.requirements]/1 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- The <tt>complex</tt> and <tt>valarray</tt> components are parameterized by the type of information they contain and
manipulate. [&hellip;]
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(1.1) &mdash; <tt>T</tt> is not an abstract class (it has no pure virtual member functions);</p></li>
<li><p>[&hellip;]</p></li>
<li><p>(1.8) &mdash; If <tt>T</tt> is a class, its assignment operator, copy and default constructors, and 
destructor shall correspond to each other in the following sense: <ins>Initialization of raw storage using 
the copy constructor on the value of <tt>T()</tt>, however obtained, is semantically equivalent to value 
initialization of the same raw storage.</ins> Initialization of raw storage using the 
default constructor, followed by assignment, is semantically equivalent to initialization of raw storage 
using the copy constructor. Destruction of an object, followed by initialization of its raw storage using 
the copy constructor, is semantically equivalent to assignment to the original object.
[<i>Note</i>: This rule states<ins>, in part,</ins> that there shall not be any subtle differences in the 
semantics of initialization versus assignment. This gives an implementation considerable flexibility in how 
arrays are initialized.
[<i>Example</i>: An implementation is allowed to initialize a <tt>valarray</tt> by allocating storage using the 
<tt>new</tt> operator (which implies a call to the default constructor for each element) and then assigning each
element its value. Or the implementation can allocate raw storage and use the copy constructor to
initialize each element. &mdash; <i>end example</i>]
If the distinction between initialization and assignment is important for a class, or if it fails to satisfy any
of the other conditions listed above, the programmer should use <tt>vector</tt> (23.3.11) instead of <tt>valarray</tt>
for that class; &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</p></li>

<p>
The current specification of <tt>operator/=</tt> taking a <tt>const Source&amp;</tt> parameter, and of 
<tt>path::append</tt> in 27.10.8.4.3 [path.append] appears to require <tt>Source</tt> to have a <tt>native()</tt> 
and an <tt>empty()</tt> member, and seemingly requires different behavior for <tt>append(<i>empty_range</i>)</tt> 
and <tt>append(first, last)</tt> when <tt>first == last</tt> (the last two bullet points being specified with 
<tt>source</tt> alone), which doesn't make any sense.
<p/>
It appears that these overloads can just be specified using the <tt>operator/=(const path&amp;)</tt> overload.

According to <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4562.html">N4562</a>, <tt>gcd</tt> and 
<tt>lcm</tt> support <tt>bool</tt> as the operand type. The wording doesn't appear to cover the behavior for that case, 
since <tt>bool</tt> does not have a zero value and <tt>gcd</tt> / <tt>lcm</tt> are not normally mathematically defined

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Consider this C++98 program:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

int main() {
  return std::abs(static_cast&lt;short&gt;(23)) % 42;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This works fine with C++98 compilers. At the <tt>std::abs(short)</tt> call, short gets promoted to <tt>int</tt> and 
<tt>std::abs(int)</tt> is called.
<p/>
C++11 added the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/n4594.pdf">following wording</a>
on page 1083 &sect;26.9 p15 b2 [c.math]:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Otherwise, if any argument of arithmetic type corresponding to a <tt>double</tt> parameter has type <tt>double</tt> 
or an integer type, then all arguments of arithmetic type corresponding to <tt>double</tt> parameters are effectively 
cast to <tt>double</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
C++17 draft <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/n4594.pdf">additionally adds</a> on
page 1080 &sect;26.9 p10 [c.math]:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If <tt>abs()</tt> is called with an argument of type <tt>X</tt> for which <tt>is_unsigned&lt;X&gt;::value</tt> is <tt>true</tt> 
and if <tt>X</tt> cannot be converted to <tt>int</tt> by integral promotion (4.5), the program is ill-formed. [<i>Note:</i> 
Arguments that can be promoted to <tt>int</tt> are permitted for compatibility with C. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is somewhat confusing and probably even contradictory to on the one hand specify <tt>abs()</tt> in terms of integral 
promotion in &sect;26.9 p10 and on the other hand demand all integral types to be converted to <tt>double</tt> in 
&sect;26.9 p15 b2.
<p/>
Most compilers (each with their own respective library implementation) I tested (MSVC, Clang, older GCC) appear to not 
consider &sect;26.9 p15 b2 for <tt>std::abs</tt> and compile the code successfully. GCC 4.5-5.3 (for <tt>std::abs</tt> but 
not for <tt>::abs</tt>) as well as GCC &gt;=6.0 (for both <tt>std::abs</tt> and <tt>::abs</tt>) fail to compile in the following 
way: Taking &sect;26.9 p15 b2 literally and applying it to <tt>abs()</tt> (which is listed in &sect;26.9 p12) results in 
<tt>abs(short)</tt> returning <tt>double</tt>, and with <tt>operator%</tt> not being specified for <tt>double</tt>, this 
makes the programm ill-formed.
<p/>
I do acknowledge the reason for the wording and semantics demanded by &sect;26.9 p15 b2, i.e. being able to call math functions 
with integral types or with partly floating point types and partly integral types. Converting integral types to <tt>double</tt>
certainly makes sense here for all the other floating point math functions.
However, <tt>abs()</tt> is special. <tt>abs()</tt> has overloads for the 3 wider integral types which return integral types. 
<tt>abs()</tt> originates in the C standard in <tt>stdlib.h</tt> and had originally been specified for integral types only. 
Calling it in C with a short argument returns an <tt>int</tt>. Calling <tt>std::abs(short)</tt> in C++98 also returns an 
<tt>int</tt>. Calling <tt>std::abs(short)</tt> in C++11 and later with &sect;26.9 p15 b2 applied to <tt>abs()</tt> suddenly 
returns a <tt>double</tt>.
<p/>
Additionally, this behaviour also breaks third-party C headers which contain macros or inline functions calling 
<tt>abs(short)</tt>.
<p/>
As per discussion on std-discussion, my reading of the standard as well as GCC's interpretation seem valid.
However, as can be seen, this breaks existing code.
<p/>
In addition to the compatibilty concerns, having <tt>std::abs(short)</tt> return <tt>double</tt> is also very confusing 
and unintuitive.
<p/>
The other (possibly, depending on their respective size relative to <tt>int</tt>) affected types besides <tt>short</tt> 
are <tt>signed char</tt>, <tt>unsigned char</tt> and <tt>unsigned short</tt>, and also <tt>char</tt>, <tt>char16_t</tt>, 
<tt>char32_t</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt>, (all of these are or may be promotable to <tt>int</tt>). Wider integral types 
are not affected because explicit overloads are specified for those types by &sect;26.9 p6, &sect;26.9 p7 and &sect;26.9 p9.
<tt>div()</tt> is also not affected because it is neither listed in &sect;26.9 p12, nor does it actually provide 
any overload for <tt>double</tt> at all.
<p/>
As far as I can see, the proposed or implemented solutions for LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2294">2294</a>, <a href="lwg-defects.html#2192">2192</a> and/or 
<a href="lwg-defects.html#2086">2086</a> do not resolve this issue.
<p/>
I think both, &sect;26.9 p10 [c.math] and &sect;26.9 p15 [c.math] need some correction and clarification.
<p/>
(Note: These changes would explicitly render the current implementation in GCC's libstdc++ non-conforming, which would 
be a good thing, as outlined above.)

<p>
In N4594, 20.17.6.5 [time.point.nonmember], <tt>operator-(time_point, duration)</tt> is specified as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template &lt;class Clock, class Duration1, class Rep2, class Period2&gt;
  constexpr time_point&lt;Clock, common_type_t&lt;Duration1, duration&lt;Rep2, Period2&gt;&gt;&gt;
  operator-(const time_point&lt;Clock, Duration1&gt;&amp; lhs, const duration&lt;Rep2, Period2&gt;&amp; rhs);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-3- <i>Returns:</i> <tt>lhs + (-rhs)</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
When <tt>Rep2</tt> is an unsigned integral type, the behavior is quite different with arithmetic of the underlying 
integral types because of the requirement to negate the incoming duration and then add that. It also ends up 
producing different results than the underlying durations as well as the non-member <tt>time_point::operator-=</tt>.
<p/>
Consider this program:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;

int main()
{
  const duration&lt;uint32_t&gt; unsignedSeconds{5};

  auto someValue = system_clock::from_time_t(200);
  cout &lt;&lt; system_clock::to_time_t(someValue) &lt;&lt; '\n';
  cout &lt;&lt; system_clock::to_time_t(someValue - unsignedSeconds) &lt;&lt; '\n';
  someValue -= unsignedSeconds;
  cout &lt;&lt; system_clock::to_time_t(someValue) &lt;&lt; '\n';

  std::chrono::seconds signedDur{200};
  cout &lt;&lt; signedDur.count() &lt;&lt; '\n';
  cout &lt;&lt; (signedDur - unsignedSeconds).count() &lt;&lt; '\n';
  signedDur -= unsignedSeconds;
  cout &lt;&lt; signedDur.count() &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The goal of the program is to compare the behavior of <tt>time_point</tt> non-member <tt>operator-</tt>, 
<tt>time_point</tt> member <tt>operator-=</tt>, <tt>duration</tt> non-member <tt>operator-</tt>, and 
<tt>duration</tt> member <tt>operator-=</tt> with basically the same inputs.
<p/>
libc++ produces this output, which appears mandated by the standard:

Given the seemingly brief coverage of durations with unsigned representations in the standard, this seems to be an 
oversight rather than a deliberate choice for this behavior. Additionally, there may be other "unexpected" behaviors 
with durations with an unsigned representation, this is just the one that I've come across.

<p>
Generally, <tt>basic_string</tt> has a constructor matching each <tt>assign</tt> function and vice versa (except the 
constructor takes an allocator where <tt>assign</tt> does not). <a href="http://wg21.link/p0254r2">P0254R2</a> violates 
this by adding an <tt>assign(basic_string_view, size_type pos, size_type n = npos)</tt> but no corresponding constructor.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08-04 Chicago LWG]</i></p>

<p>
Robert Douglas provides initial wording.
<p/>
We decided against another constructor overload to avoid the semantic confusion between:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(char const*, size_type length, Allocator = Allocator())
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T, class Foo = is_convertible_v&lt;T const&amp;, basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt;&gt;
basic_string(T const&amp;, size_type pos, Allocator = Allocator())
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
where someone might call:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string("HelloWorld", 5, 5);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and get "World", but then call
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string("HelloWorld", 5);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and instead get "Hello". The second parameter changes between length and position.

The <tt>in_place</tt> constructor that takes an <tt>initializer_list</tt> has both a <i>Requires:</i>
for <tt>is_constructible</tt> and a <i>Remarks:</i> for <tt>is_constructible</tt>. The one

<p/>
I think both of those should be <i>Remarks:</i>, i.e. SFINAEable constraints.
Otherwise querying is_constructible for an any with <tt>in_place_t</tt> will
not give a reasonable answer, and I utterly fail to see any implementation
burden in SFINAEing those constructors.

<p>
LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#2451">2451</a> adds conditionally explicit converting constructors to <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt> that accept:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Types convertible to <tt>T</tt>: <tt>template &lt;class U&gt; constexpr optional(T&amp;&amp;);</tt></li>
<li>Rvalue <tt>optional&lt;U&gt;</tt> when <tt>U&amp;&amp;</tt> is convertible to <tt>T</tt>: 
<tt>template &lt;class U&gt; constexpr optional(optional&lt;U&gt;&amp;&amp;);</tt></li>
<li>Lvalue <tt>const optional&lt;U&gt;</tt> when <tt>const U&amp;</tt> is convertible to <tt>T</tt>: 
<tt>template &lt;class U&gt; constexpr optional(const optional&lt;U&gt;&amp;);</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>
All three of these constructors are required to be <tt>constexpr</tt> "If <tt>T</tt>'s selected constructor is a 
<tt>constexpr</tt> constructor". While this is not problematic for #1, it is not possible in the current language 
to implement signatures #2 and #3 as <tt>constexpr</tt> functions for the same reasons that <tt>optional</tt>'s 
<em>non-converting</em> constructors from <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt>const optional&lt;T&gt;&amp;</tt> 
cannot be <tt>constexpr</tt>.
<p/>
We should remove the "<tt>constexpr</tt>" specifier from the declarations of the conditionally explicit converting 
constructors that accept <tt>optional&lt;U&gt;&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt>const optional&lt;U&gt;&amp;</tt>, and strike 
the remarks requiring these constructors to be <tt>constexpr</tt>.

25.3.4 [alg.foreach] p3 says <i>Returns:</i> <tt>std::move(f)</tt>.
<p/>
12.8 [class.copy] says that since <tt>f</tt> is a function parameter overload resolution to select the constructor 
for the return value is first performed as if for an rvalue, so the <tt>std::move</tt> is redundant.
<p/>
It could be argued that it isn't entirely redundant, because it says that implementations can't do something slightly different like return an lvalue reference that is bound to <tt>f</tt>, which would prevent it being treated as an rvalue. We should discuss it.

<tt>variant</tt> does not play nice with swappable traits, the non-member specialized <tt>swap</tt> overload is not 
SFINAE friendly. On the other hand, the member <tt>swap</tt> is SFINAE friendly, albeit with an incomplete condition, 
when arguably it shouldn't be. Given the <i>Effects</i>, <i>Throws</i>, and <i>Remarks</i> clauses, the SFINAE 
condition should include <tt>is_move_constructible_v</tt> and <tt>is_move_assignable_v</tt> to account for the 
involvement of <tt>variant</tt>'s move constructor and move assignment operator (the <tt>noexcept</tt> specification is 
correct as is, since the move assignment operator would only be called for <tt>variant</tt>s with different alternatives). 
This SFINAE condition should apply to the non-member <tt>swap</tt> overload, while the member <tt>swap</tt> should require 
all alternatives are swappable (as defined by 17.6.3.2 [swappable.requirements]).

It is possible to exchange the value of two variants using only move construction on the alternative types, as if by
<pre>
auto tmp = move(x);
x.emplace&lt;<i>i</i>&gt;(move(y));
y.emplace&lt;<i>j</i>&gt;(move(tmp));
</pre> 
where <i>i</i> is <tt>y.index()</tt> and <i>j</i> is <tt>tmp.index()</tt>. Consequently, <tt>variant</tt>'s member swap
need not require move assignable alternatives.

LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#2451">2451</a> adds a converting constructor to <tt>optional</tt> with signature:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template &lt;class U&gt;
constexpr optional(U&amp;&amp; v);

<p>
and specifies that "This constructor shall not participate in overload resolution unless 
<tt>is_constructible_v&lt;T, U&amp;&amp;&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt> and <tt>U</tt> is not the same type as <tt>T</tt>." 
This suffices to avoid this constructor being selected by overload resolution for arguments that should match the 
move constructor, but not for arguments that should match the copy constructor. The recent churn around tuple's 
constructors suggests that we want this constructor to not participate in overload resolution if 
<tt>remove_cv_t&lt;remove_reference_t&lt;U&gt;&gt;</tt> is the same type as <tt>T</tt>.

<p>
<tt>std::async</tt> is a request from the user for type erasure; as any given function gets passed to <tt>async</tt>
which returns only <tt>future&lt;ReturnType&gt;</tt>. Therefore, it needs to be able to allocate memory, as other issues
(e.g. LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2202">2202</a>) indicate. However, async's <em>Throws</em> clause doesn't allow an implementation to do
this, as it permits only <tt>future_error</tt>.
<p/>
<tt>std::packaged_task</tt>'s constructor allocates memory using a user supplied allocator. An implementation needs to
call the user's <tt>allocate</tt> to allocate such memory. The user's allocate function is not constrained to throwing
only <tt>bad_alloc</tt>; it can raise whatever it wants, but <tt>packaged_task</tt>'s constructor prohibits this.

<p>
To use <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt> as if it were a <tt>T</tt> in generic contexts, <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt>'s "generic" 
operations must behave as do those of <tt>T</tt> under overload resolution. At minimum, <tt>optional</tt>'s constructors 
and assignment operators should not participate in overload resolution with argument types that cannot be used to 
construct/assign the contained <tt>T</tt> so that <tt>is_constructible_v&lt;optional&lt;T&gt;, Args...&gt;</tt> 
(respectively <tt>is_assignable_v&lt;optional&lt;T&gt;&amp;, RHS&gt;</tt>) is equivalent to 
<tt>is_constructible_v&lt;T, Args...&gt;</tt> (respectively <tt>is_assignable_v&lt;T&amp;, RHS&gt;</tt>).
</p>
<p>
In passing, note that the Requires element for <tt>optional</tt>'s in-place <tt>initializer_list</tt> constructor 
unnecessarily duplicates its Remarks element; it should be removed.
</p>
<p>
It should also be noted that the resolution of LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#2451">2451</a> adds constructors to <tt>optional</tt> with 
appropriate constraints, but does not constrain the additional assignment operators. If LWG chooses to apply the 
resolution of 2451 to the WP, the Requires elements of the additional assignment operators should also be converted 
to constraints as the wording herein does for the assignment operators in N4606.

<p>
The <tt>in_place</tt> constructors and <tt>emplace</tt> functions
added by <a href="http://wg21.link/p0032r3">P0032R3</a> don't require <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>.
<p/>
They must. Otherwise copying an <tt>any</tt> that's made to hold a non-<tt>CopyConstructible</tt>
type must fail with a run-time error. Since that's crazy, we want to prevent
storing non-<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> types in an <tt>any</tt>.
<p/>
Previously, the requirement for <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> was just on the converting
constructor template and the converting assignment operator template on <tt>any</tt>.
Now that we are adding two <tt>in_place</tt> constructor overloads and two
<tt>emplace</tt> overloads, it seems reasonable to require <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> in some more 
general location, in order to avoid repeating that requirement all over the place.

be stored as object into an <tt>any</tt>, this prevented storing arrays, references, functions, and <i>cv</i>-qualified
types. The new constraints added my Ville do prevent some of these types (e.g. neither arrays nor functions meet
the <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> requirements), but we need to cope with <i>cv</i>-qualified types and reference types.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08-02: Agust&iacute;n K-ballo Berg&eacute; comments]</i></p>

<p>
Presumably the constructors <tt>any(in_place_type_t&lt;T&gt;, ...)</tt> would need to be modified in the same way 
the <tt>emplace</tt> overloads were.

Drafting note: this P/R doesn't turn the <i>Requires</i>-clauses into <i>Remarks</i>-clauses.
We might want to do that separately, because SFINAEing the constructors
allows users to query for <tt>is_constructible</tt> and get the right answer. Failing
to mandate the SFINAE will lead to non-portable answers for <tt>is_constructible</tt>.
Currently, libstdc++ SFINAEs. That should be done as a separate issue,
as this issue is an urgent bug-fix but the mandated SFINAE is not.

<p><i>[2016-08-03: Ville comments and revises his proposed wording]</i></p>

<p>
After discussing the latest P/R, here's an update. What this update does is that:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It strikes the <i>Requires</i>-clauses and does <em>not</em> add
<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> to the <i>Requires</i>-clauses.
<p/>
Rationale: <tt>any</tt> doesn't care whether the type it holds satisfies the
semantic requirements of the <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> concept. The syntactic 
requirements are now SFINAE constraints in <i>Requires</i>-clauses.</p></li>
<li><p>It reverts back towards <tt>decay_t</tt> rather than <tt>remove_cv_t</tt>, and does
<em>not</em> add the suggested SFINAE constraints for <tt>is_reference</tt>/<tt>is_array</tt>/<tt>is_function</tt>.
<p/>
Rationale:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li><p><tt>any</tt> decays by design. It's to some extent inconsistent
to not protect against decay in the <tt>ValueType</tt> constructor/assignment operator, but to protect
against decay in the <tt>in_place_t</tt> constructors and <tt>emplace</tt> functions</p></li>
<li><p>I think it's saner to just decay than to potentially run into
situations where I need to <tt>remove_reference</tt> inside <tt>in_place_t</tt>.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Based on that, this P/R should supersede the previous one. We want to
look at this new P/R in LWG and potentially send it to LEWG for verification. 
Personally, I think this P/R is the more conservative one, doesn't add 
significant new functionality, and is consistent, and is
thus not really Library-Evolutionary.

<p>
LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#2451">2451</a> adds converting constructors and assignment operators to <tt>optional</tt>. The committee 
voted to apply it to the Library Fundamentals 2 TS WP in Oulu as part of LWG Motion 3. In both LWG and LEWG 
discussion of this issue, it was considered to be critical to apply to the specification of <tt>optional</tt> 
before shipping C++17 &mdash; it was an oversight on the part of LWG that there was no motion brought to apply 
this resolution to the C++ WP.
<p/>
LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2745">2745</a> proposes removal of the <tt>constexpr</tt> specifier from the declarations of the 
converting constructors from <tt>const optional&lt;U&gt;&amp;</tt> and <tt>optional&lt;U&gt;&amp;&amp;</tt> 
since they are not implementable as <tt>constexpr</tt> constructors in C++17.
<p/>
This issue proposes application of the resolution of LWG <a href="lwg-defects.html#2451">2451</a> as amended by LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2745">2745</a> 
to the specification of <tt>optional</tt> in the C++ WP.

<ol>
<li><p>Value forwarding constructor (<tt>template&lt;typename U&gt; optional(U&amp;&amp;)</tt>) is underspecified.</p>
<p>For the following use code:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
optional&lt;T&gt; o1;
optional&lt;T&gt; o2(o1);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The second constructor will invoke value forwarding <tt>(U = optional&lt;T&gt;&amp;)</tt> constructor (better match) 
instead of the <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt> copy constructor, in case if <tt>T</tt> can be constructed from 
<tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt>. This happens for any type <tt>T</tt> that has unconstrained perfect forwarding constructor, 
especially <tt>optional&lt;any&gt;</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The behavior of the construction of the <tt>optional&lt;T&gt; ot</tt> from <tt>optional&lt;U&gt; ou</tt> is 
inconsistent for classes <tt>T</tt> than can be constructed both from <tt>optional&lt;U&gt;</tt> and <tt>U</tt>. 
There are two possible semantics for such operation:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>unwrapping:</em> if <tt>ou</tt> is initialized (<tt>bool(ou)</tt>), initialize contained value of <tt>ot</tt> 
from <tt>*ou</tt>, otherwise make <tt>ot</tt> uninitialized (<tt>!bool(ot)</tt>)</p></li>
<li><p><em>value forwarding:</em> initialize contained value of <tt>ot</tt> from <tt>ou</tt>, <tt>ot</tt> is always 
initialized (<tt>bool(ot)</tt>). 
<p/>
With the proposed resolution, construction is preferring <em>value forwarding</em>, 
while assignment is always using <em>unwrapping</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, if we consider following class:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
struct Widget
{
  Widget(int);
  Widget(optional&lt;int&gt;);
};
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice, that such set of constructor is pretty common in situation when the construction of the 
<tt>Widget</tt> from known value is common and usage of <tt>optional</tt> version is rare. In such situation, 
presence of <tt>Widget(int)</tt> construction is an optimization used to avoid unnecessary empty checks and 
construction <tt>optional&lt;int&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
For the following declarations:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
optional&lt;Widget&gt; w1(make_optional(10));
optional&lt;Widget&gt; w2;
w2 = make_optional(10);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>w1</tt> will contain a value created using <tt>Widget(optional&lt;int&gt;)</tt> constructor, 
as corresponding <em>unwrapping</em> constructor (<tt>optional&lt;U&gt; const&amp;</tt>) is eliminated by 
<tt>is_constructible_v&lt;T, const optional&lt;U&gt;&amp;&gt;</tt> 
(<tt>is_constructible_v&lt;Widget, const optional&lt;int&gt;&amp;&gt;</tt>) having a <tt>true</tt> value.
In contrast <tt>w2</tt> will contain a value created using <tt>Widget(int)</tt> constructor, as corresponding 
value forwarding assignment (<tt>U&amp;&amp;</tt>) is eliminated by the fact that 
<tt>std::decay_t&lt;U&gt;</tt> (<tt>optional&lt;int&gt;</tt>) is specialization of <tt>optional</tt>.
<p/>
In addition, the construction is having a preference for <em>value forwarding</em> and assignment is always using 
<em>unwrapping</em>. That means that for the following class:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct Thingy
{
   Thingy(optional&lt;string&gt;);
};

optional&lt;Thingy&gt; t1(optional&lt;string&gt;("test"));
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>t1</tt> has a contained value constructed from using <tt>Thingy(optional&lt;std::string&gt;)</tt>, 
as unwrapping constructor (<tt>optional&lt;U&gt; const&amp;</tt>) are eliminated by the 
<tt>is_constructible&lt;T, U const&amp;&gt;</tt> (<tt>is_constructible&lt;Thingy, std::string const&amp;&gt;</tt>) 
being <tt>false</tt>. However the following:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
t1 = optional&lt;std::string&gt;("test2");
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
will not compile, because, the <em>value forwarding</em> assignment (<tt>U&amp;&amp;</tt>) is eliminated by 
<tt>std::decay_t&lt;U&gt;</tt> (<tt>optional&lt;std::string&gt;</tt>) being optional specialization and the 
<em>unwrapping</em> assignment (<tt>optional&lt;U&gt; const&amp;</tt>) is ill-formed because 
<tt>is_constructible&lt;T, U const&amp;&gt;</tt> (<tt>is_constructible&lt;Thingy, std::string const&amp;&gt;</tt>) 
is <tt>false</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The semantics of construction and assignment, of <tt>optional&lt;optional&lt;V&gt;&gt;</tt> from 
<tt>optional&lt;U&gt;</tt> where <tt>U</tt> is convertible to/ same as <tt>T</tt> is also inconsistent. Firstly, 
in this situation the <tt>optional&lt;V&gt;</tt> is a type that can be constructed both from 
<tt>optional&lt;U&gt;</tt> and <tt>U</tt> so it fails into set of problem described above. However in 
addition we have following non-template constructor in <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
optional(T const&amp;);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Which for <tt>optional&lt;optional&lt;V&gt;&gt;</tt> is equivalent to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
optional(optional&lt;V&gt; const&amp;);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
While there is no corresponding non-template assignment from <tt>T const&amp;</tt>, to make sure that 
<tt>o = {};</tt> always clear an <tt>optional o</tt>.
<p/>
So for the following declarations:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
optional&lt;int&gt; oi;
optional&lt;short&gt; os;

optional&lt;optional&lt;int&gt;&gt; ooi1(oi);
optional&lt;optional&lt;int&gt;&gt; ooi2(os);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>ooi1</tt> uses <em>from-<tt>T</tt></em> constructor, while <tt>ooi2</tt> uses <em>value forwarding</em> constructor. 
In this case both <tt>ooi1</tt> and <tt>ooi2</tt> are initialized and their contained values <tt>*ooi1</tt>, 
<tt>*ooi2</tt> are uninitialized <tt>optional</tt>s. However, if we will attempt to make construction consistent 
with assignment, by preferring <em>unwrapping</em> (<tt>optional&lt;U&gt; const&amp;</tt>), then <tt>ooi2</tt> 
will end up being uninitialized.
<p/>
In summary, I believe that relation between <em>unwrapping</em>, <em>value forwarding</em> and 
<em>from-<tt>T</tt></em> construction/assignment is to subtle to being handled as defect report and requires 
a full paper analyzing possible design and their pros/cons.

<p><i>[2016-08-05 Chicago LWG]</i></p>

<p>
Ville provides revised wording, that also fixes LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2753">2753</a>.
<p/>
Rationale:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The resolution of LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2753">2753</a> makes special
member functions defined as deleted in case the desired
constraints aren't met.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no decay for the converting
constructor <tt>optional(U&amp;&amp;)</tt>, there is a <tt>remove_reference</tt> instead.
The target type may hold a <i>cv</i>-qualified type, and the incoming
type may hold a <i>cv</i>-qualified type, but neither can hold a reference.
Thus, <tt>remove_reference</tt> is what we need, <tt>remove_cv</tt> would
be wrong, and <tt>decay</tt> would be wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no <tt>decay</tt> or <tt>remove_reference</tt> for converting constructors like
<tt>optional(optional&lt;U&gt;)</tt>, because none is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>For <tt>optional(U&amp;&amp;)</tt>, an added constraint is that <tt>U</tt> is
not a specialization of <tt>optional</tt></p></li>

<p><i>[2016-08-08 Ville reopens and provides improved wording]</i></p>

<p>
This alternative proposed wording also resolves <a href="lwg-active.html#2753">2753</a>.
<p/>
The constructors that take a const <code>T&amp;</code> or <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> are replaced by 
a constructor template that takes a <code>U&amp;&amp;</code> and defaults <code>U = T</code>. This 
allows copy-list-initialization with empty braces to still work:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
optional&lt;<em>whatever</em>&gt; o = {}; <i>// equivalent to initializing <code>optional</code> with <code>nullopt</code></i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This resolution makes converting constructors and assignments have the same capabilities, including 
using arguments that can't be deduced. That is achieved by using a perfect-forwarding constructor
and an assignment operator that default their argument to <code>T</code>. We don't need separate 
overloads for <code>T</code>, the overload for <code>U</code> does the job:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
optional&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; ovi{{1, 2, 3}}; // still works
ovi = {4, 5, 6, 7}; // now works, didn't work before
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Furthermore, this proposed wording makes <code>optional</code> "always unwrap". That is, the result 
of the following initializations is the same:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
optional&lt;optional&lt;int&gt;&gt; oi = optional&lt;int&gt;();
optional&lt;optional&lt;int&gt;&gt; oi = optional&lt;short&gt;();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of those initializations initialize the <code>optional</code> wrapping
another <code>optional</code> as if initializing with <code>nullopt</code>. Assignments
do the same. These changes solve the issues pointed out by Tomasz Kami&nacute;ski.
<p/>
This P/R has been implemented and tested as a modification on top of libstdc++'s <code>optional</code>.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08-08 Ville and Tomasz collaborate and improve wording]</i></p>

<p>
The suggested wording retains <tt>optional</tt>'s converting constructors and assignment
operators, but provides sane results for the types Tomasz Kaminski depicts
in previous discussions.
<p/>
As opposed to the current P/R of this issue, which does "always unwrap",
this P/R does "always value-forward unless the incoming type is exactly
a type that a special member function takes by reference, and don't
unwrap if a value-forwarder can take an optional by any kind of reference".
<p/>
I and Tomasz believe this is the best compromise between the different
desires, and thus the best outcome so far.
<p/>
This P/R has been implemented and tested on libstdc++.

<p><b>Section:</b> 21.3.1.6.4 [string::insert] <b>Status:</b> <a href="lwg-active.html#Resolved">Tentatively Resolved</a>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Before C++17, we had the following signature to <tt>std::basic_string</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string&amp;
  insert(size_type pos1, const basic_string&amp; str, size_type pos2, size_type n = npos);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Unlike most of the other member functions on <tt>std::basic_string</tt>, there were not corresponding
versions that take a <tt>charT*</tt> or <tt>(charT *, size)</tt>.
<p/>
In <a href="http://wg21.link/p0254r2">p0254r2</a>, we added:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string&amp;
  insert(size_type pos1, basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; sv, size_type pos2, size_type n = npos);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
which made the code above ambiguous. There are two conversions from "<tt>const charT*</tt>", 
one to <tt>basic_string</tt>, and the other to <tt>basic_string_view</tt>, and they're both equally 
good (in the view of the compiler).
<p/>
This ambiguity also occurs with the calls
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
assign(const basic_string&amp; str,             size_type pos, size_type n = npos);
assign(basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; sv, size_type pos, size_type n = npos);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
but I will file a separate issue (<a href="lwg-active.html#2758">2758</a>) for that.
<p/>
A solution is to add <em>even more</em> overloads to <tt>insert</tt>, to make it match all the other member
functions of <tt>basic_string</tt>, which come in fours (<tt>string</tt>, <tt>pointer</tt>, <tt>pointer + size</tt>, 
<tt>string_view</tt>).

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Before C++17, we had the following signature to <tt>std::basic_string</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string&amp;
  assign(const basic_string&amp; str, size_type pos, size_type n = npos);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Unlike most of the other member functions on <tt>std::basic_string</tt>, there were not corresponding
versions that take a <tt>charT*</tt> or <tt>(charT *, size)</tt>.
<p/>
In <a href="http://wg21.link/p0254r2">p0254r2</a>, we (I) added:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string&amp;
  assign(basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; sv, size_type pos, size_type n = npos);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
which made the code above ambiguous. There are two conversions from "<tt>const charT*</tt>", 
one to <tt>basic_string</tt>, and the other to <tt>basic_string_view</tt>, and they're both equally 
good (in the view of the compiler).
<p/>
This ambiguity also occurs with the calls
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
insert(size_type pos1, const basic_string&amp; str,             size_type pos2, size_type n = npos);
insert(size_type pos1, basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt; sv, size_type pos2, size_type n = npos);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
but I will file a separate issue (<a href="lwg-active.html#2757">2757</a>) for that.
<p/>
A solution is to add <em>even more</em> overloads to <tt>assign</tt>, to make it match all the other member
functions of <tt>basic_string</tt>, which come in fours (<tt>string</tt>, <tt>pointer</tt>, <tt>pointer + size</tt>, 
<tt>string_view</tt>).
</p>

<p><i>[2016-08-05, Tim Song comments]</i></p>

<p>
On the assumption that the <tt>basic_string</tt> version is untouchable, I like the updated P/R, with a couple comments:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If it's constraining on <tt>is_convertible</tt> to <tt>basic_string_view</tt>, then I think it should take 
by reference to avoid copying <tt>T</tt>, which can be arbitrarily expensive. Both <tt>const T&amp;</tt> and 
<tt>T&amp;&amp;</tt> should work; the question is whether to accommodate non-const <tt>operator basic_string_view()</tt>s 
(which arguably shouldn't exist).</p></li>
<li><p>Minor issue: <tt>compare</tt> tests <tt>is_convertible</tt> and then uses direct-initialization syntax 
(which is <tt>is_constructible</tt>). They should match, because it's possible to have <tt>basic_string_view sv = t;</tt> 
succeed yet <tt>basic_string_view sv(t);</tt> fail.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2016-08-05, Chicago LWG]</i></p>

<ol>
<li>breaking ABI was a non-starter</li>
<li>we want to convert <tt>char const*</tt> to <tt>basic_string_view</tt> if possible</li>
<li>we want to take the original type by reference, to avoid new user string types from being copied</li>
<li>it is unfortunate that each length of string literal will generate a new entry in the symbol table</li>
</ol>
<p>Given feedback from discussion, we wish to go with the <tt>is_convertible_v</tt> method, but change:</p>
<ol>
<li>the function parameter type to <tt>T const&amp;</tt> for each overload</li>
<li>the parameter type in <tt>is_convertible_v</tt> to <tt>T const&amp;</tt></li>
<li>the initialization of <tt>sv(t)</tt> to <tt>sv = t</tt></li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2016-08, Chicago]</i></p>

<p>Fri PM: Move to Tentatively Ready</p>

<p><i>[2016-08-16, Jonathan Wakeley reopens]</i></p>

<p>
The P/R is not correct, the new overloads get chosen in preference to
the overloads taking <tt>const char*</tt> when passed a <tt>char*</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main () {
  std::string str("a");
  char c = 'b';
  str.replace(0, 1, &amp;c, 1);
  if (str[0] != 'b')
    __builtin_abort();
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
With the resolution of 2758 this is now equivalent to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
str.replace(0, 1, string_view{&amp;c, 1}, 1);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
which replaces the character with <tt>string_view{"b", 1}.substr(1, npos)</tt>
i.e. an empty string.
<p/>
The SFINAE constraints need to disable the new overloads for (at
least) the case of non-const <tt>value_type*</tt> arguments.
<p/>
I've implemented an alternative resolution, which would be specified as:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Remarks:</i> This function shall not participate in overload resolution
unless <tt>is_convertible_v&lt;const T&amp;, basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt;&gt;</tt> is
<tt>true</tt> <ins>and <tt>is_convertible_v&lt;const T&amp;, const charT*&gt;</tt> is <tt>false</tt></ins>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
All the overloads have the same problem.
<p/>
This program prints no output in C++14, and we should make sure it prints no output in C++17 too:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
  std::string str("a");
  char c[1] = { 'b' };
  str.append(c, 1);
  if (str != "ab")
    puts("bad append");
  str.assign(c, 1);
  if (str != "b")
    puts("bad assign");
  str.insert(0, c, 1);
  if (str != "bb")
    puts("bad insert");
  str.replace(0, 2, c, 1);
  if (str != "b")
    puts("bad replace");
  if (str.compare(0, 1, c, 1))
    puts("bad compare");
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Ville and I considered "<tt>is_same_v&lt;decay_t&lt;T&gt;, char*&gt;</tt> is <tt>false</tt>" but
that would still select the wrong overload for an array of const <tt>char</tt>,
because the new function template would be preferred to doing an array-to-pointer conversion to 
call the old overload.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-09-09 Issues Resolution Telecom]</i></p>

<p>Ville to provide updated wording; Marshall to implement</p>
  
<p><i>[2016-10-05]</i></p>

<p>
Ville provides revised wording.
</p>

<p><i>[2016-10 Telecom]</i></p>

<p>Ville's wording has been implemented in libstdc++ and libc++. Move this to Tentatively Ready and <a href="lwg-active.html#2757">2757</a> to Tentatively Resolved</p>

<a href="lwg-defects.html#1123">1123</a> fixed a bug where users of <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> were not guaranteed to have their streams flushed 
on program shutdown. However, it also added this rule:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Similarly, the entire program shall behave as if there were at least one instance of <tt>ios_base::Init</tt> with static 
lifetime."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This seems pointless: it only affects the behavior of programs that never include <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> (because programs 
that do include it are already guaranteed at least one such instance), and those programs do not need an implicit flush 
because they cannot have written to the relevant streams.
<p/>
It's also actively harmful, because it requires the iostreams component to be linked into programs that do not use it, 
apparently even including freestanding implementations! Fortunately, C++ implementations appear to uniformly ignore this rule.
<p/>
Can it be removed?

<p>
The definition of the <tt><i>call_wrapper</i></tt> type in the C++17 CD means this
fails to compile:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;functional&gt;

struct abc { virtual void f() const = 0; };
struct derived : abc { void f() const { } };
struct F { bool operator()(abc&amp;) { return false; } };
derived d;
bool b = std::not_fn(F{})(static_cast&lt;abc&amp;&amp;&gt;(d));
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The problem is that the return types use <tt>result_of_t&lt;F(abc)&gt;</tt> and
<tt>F(abc)</tt> is not a valid function type, because it takes an abstract
class by value.
<p/>
The return types should use <tt>result_of_t&lt;F(Args<ins>&amp;&amp;</ins>...)&gt;</tt> instead.

<p>
Some <tt>basic_string::compare</tt> functions are specified in terms of a non-existing <tt>basic_string_view</tt>
constructor, namely 21.3.1.7.9 [string::compare] p3,
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
return basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt;(this.data(), pos1, n1).compare(sv);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and 21.3.1.7.9 [string::compare] p4:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
return basic_string_view&lt;charT, traits&gt;(this.data(), pos1, n1).compare(sv, pos2, n2);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
because there doesn't exist a <tt>basic_string_view</tt> constructor with three arguments.
<p/>
Albeit this can be easily fixed by a proper combination of the existing constructor
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr basic_string_view(const charT* str, size_type len);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
with the additional member function
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr basic_string_view substr(size_type pos = 0, size_type n = npos) const;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
it should be decided whether adding the seemingly natural constructor
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr basic_string_view(const charT* str, size_type pos, size_type n);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
could simplify matters. A counter argument for this addition might be, that <tt>basic_string</tt>
doesn't provide this constructor either.
<p/>
Another problem is related to the specification of 21.3.1.7.9 [string::compare] p4, which attempts to
call a non-existing <tt>basic_string_view::compare</tt> overload that would match the signature:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>

Currently <tt>std::ignore</tt> is not specified <tt>constexpr</tt> according to the C++ draft N4606 in the paragraph 
20.5.1 [tuple.general]. It prevents some use in <tt>constexpr</tt> context: for example declaring a

</p>
<blockquote><pre>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
<tt>basic_string_view</tt> was not updated to account for other library
machinery made <tt>constexpr</tt> in Oulu. Now that <tt>reverse_iterator</tt> is
<tt>constexpr</tt> there's no reason the reverse range functions can't be.
Also, now that we have C++14 relaxed <tt>constexpr</tt>, we can also take care
of the assignment operator and <tt>copy</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[Issues processing Telecom 2016-10-7]</i></p>

<p>split off the copy into its' own issue <a href="lwg-active.html#2780">2780</a></p>
<p>P0; set what's left to Tentatively Ready</p>
